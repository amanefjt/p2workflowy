2. REGISTERS OF COMPARISONIts diffuseness does not mean that the concept of relation is innocent of history or ideology or whatever will reveal its worldliness.11 ponder on this through materials where the reader’s likely familiarity with them will perhaps allow something of a larger enterprise to be seen in a small part. Comparisons between kinship and friendship, such as we have already encountered, are frequent in the English vernacular. While exposition will entail further inquiry into interpersonal relations, the focus of this chapter is on comparison, on the epistemic relation. In common usage, "comparison” can both include the alignment of similarities and differences or be distinguished as focused on similarities by contrast with “contrast.” Comparison and contrast thus point to each other. Comparing or contrasting ideas about family and friends may show up an ambiguity in the terms through the very attempt to reduce it. Brought together, the two terms otherwise tend to cross over and slide around each other. For their part, sociologists as well as anthropologists may affirm the affinity of kinship and friendship by glossing them as “personal relations.” This appears to specify a type of relation, yet it is one that, by contrast with many other relations (including those of kinship), announces itself as basically formless; it seems to summon no more than a general associational ethos between individuals. Before noting how such an ethos may be discerned in vernacular usage, an initial comment is in order.Having spent some time in the past problematizing comparison, if not actually doing away with it, naming it here allows me to be explicit on a point that also concerns its avatar, relation. I am not speaking in my own words, except insofar as they are words of scrutiny, but rather describing how comparison, and relation, works in English/Euro-American? (Of course I speak English/Euro-American, too, and am not excluding all of myself when referring to such usage.) The point is that I am not here interested in making an argument about comparison; I am very interested in how comparison is used in argumentation.iAn Associational EthosWhen people draw on kinship idioms to refer to occasional meetings with erstwhile strangers, comparison may be implied. It is a feature to be found in the English literary association the Henry Williamson Society, which gathers together enthusiasts for this deceased author. Society members sometimes refer to their annual meetings as “family” gatherings.1 That they are not acquainted along any other axis, Reed (2011) claims, does not detract from the quality of their relationships. This rests on a comparison of experiences, and the special kind of shared knowledge that results, above all, from how the first encounter with Williamson’s books had been a life-changing moment. Readers report being taken over by this writer crashing into the living room, displacing the reality of ordinary domestic relations. The Society itself has a clear organizational purpose: to afford enthusiasts, unable to communicate their feelings about the author to those near them, the luxury of being with others in the know. Such an associational ethos has long been an unremarkable manifestation of social life, made explicit in the countless societies within society calling themselves “societies,” in the sense that became popular in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English?Society enthusiasts find themselves "occupying or occupied by another consciousness and so looking at the world from a perspective that is not their own” (Reed 2011: 10). They feel they know the author personally. This duplication of consciousness works at a distance, in theirtemporal separation from Henry, as well as through the intermittency of their gatherings. Such exercises of the imagination are elicited by the practice of solitary reading; readeriy enthusiasm comes to isolate them from those who are otherwise close, including family: "Kin, colleagues, friends or neighbours may appear... like strangers” (10). Where strangers are like kin, kin can appear strangers. Estrangement seems manifest in the failure to communicate, a common experience in dedication to a cause where the most familiar persons appear not to understand. What Weston (2018) finds in writers of the Scottish Enlightenment, a specific evocation of sympathy as action at a distance, could almost describe the intimacy that his devotees claim with Henry and the bonds they activate among themselves. Weston is interrogating contemporary presumptions that, to the contrary, equate closeness with proximity and with feelings of both sympathy and empathy, but perhaps it is these that also come into play in the reversal of relations between kin and strangers on which Reed reports. It is not just that kin, friend, acquaintance, stranger all seem at times interchangeable. The frisson for Henry’s associates surely rests on an unexpected sense of how to think about intimacy or what to expect from proximity. This throws into relief the regular ordering of interpersonal relations through vernacular comparisons based on formulating closeness and distance.It is a peculiarity of the way interpersonal relations are generally depicted in English that distance is often taken as a matter of degree, leading to a sliding scale in the extent to which persons admit others as near to or far from themselves. It was precisely this circumspectness that, in taking over their consciousness, Henry took away from his readers. Measures of closeness and distance can coordinate almost any dimension of social life, including assumptions about increasing and decreasing knowledge in the form of knowledge of the self and acknowledgment of others. Such measures also organize rather simple notions of security and enmity, as in the idea that strangers are more distant than friends and accordingly more likely to be hostile or that people one does not know are more threatening than those one does (as in fearing aliens and fearing that aliens will think the same). The map we may suppose in people's heads at such moments outlines a kind of sociogeographic field of ever-widening concentric rings, within which all manner of others can be placed.5Relations imagined as connections between persons draw on both connotations of distance: the one that summons a presence through the exercise of imagination and the one that rests axiomatically on perceived degrees of proximity.- The connotations may work together. Perhaps some of the frisson, mystery even, that surrounds the concept of "friend” is the sense of a closeness that works equally "at” (stimulated by, a function of) or “over” (bridging or obviating) a distance. While friendship brings a general assumption of close connection, its purported characteristics range from mutual interest to disinterestedness, and strangers, acquaintances, and kin may be as easily turned into friends as they are held distinct from them. Insofar as the uses to which English speakers put these terms indicate something of the form in which their social world appears, their implicit knowledge of the appropriate social context invariably sorts out the relevant connotation. The long-term question for our purposes is how to characterize the amorphous character of that which, precisely, requires such sorting out.Knowledge Close and DistantPondering explicitly on interpersonal relations and the effect of distance (both connotations coming into play), Biagioli (2006) offers a comparison across two moments in time. Springing from what was afterward called the scientific revolution, they concern credibility: the manner in which Galileo was credited with having made astronomical observations and how more than fifty years later the Royal Society of London established its reputation. It turns out to be a comparison of comparisons.When Galileo was staking everything on his detection of what we would call relations (see chapter 1). these were essentially comparisons of the respective positionings of phenomena. Another comparison also raised its head: that between astronomy and what was known of theastronomer. At a critical period in the development of his telescope, Biagioli argues (2006: 14- 15), “distance and limited information” emerged as a condition for the construction of Galileo's personal credibility. In 1610 he was jockeying for Medici patronage for his investigation of Jupiter’s satellites. Keen in turn for an enlargement of renown, the family allowed him to use their name for the “Medician stars." They were in Florence, he in Padua. They pressed him for a demonstration, but finally acceded to their name being used in advance of receiving the instruments that would enable them to see what Galileo saw. Now Galileo had already sent the first printed account of his discoveries to an acquaintance, the Medici ambassador in Prague, asking if he would solicit the Imperial Mathematician Johannes Kepler’s opinion. (Had he been nearby, Kepler would have realized that Galileo had not yet received patronly endorsement.) Kepler, who represented Galileo as a longtime friend, had no access to a suitable telescope either; and when he enthusiastically confirmed the discoveries, it was without having seen the stars for himself. (Some thought the spatial distance from which he wrote gave a disinterested cast to his support.) Biagioli pinpoints the role that partial knowledge played in building up reputation. This world of patronage entailed sustaining links between individuals “known” to one another who vouchsafed one another's credibility. The link, a guarantee of trust in the person, sometimes meant taking other kinds of knowledge on trust, too.The partial nature of knowledge at a distance also operated in the "kind of corporate infrastructures typical of scientific academies,” as the transition from patronage to the institutionbased frameworks of early modern natural philosophy shows (Biagioli 2006: 45). After its establishment in 1662, the Royal Society rapidly found itself the object of voluminous correspondence from scholars and amateurs across Europe. Its secretary realized that in sending the Society accounts of diverse experiments, attaching themselves to its endeavor, these correspondents were also furnishing it with the very signs of scientific activity. He set up a journal: while few people came to meetings and there was often a dearth of local experiments to report, the journal could be a carrier of this external interest and thereby broadcast a message about the Society's success. “In exchange for the sense of partaking in a prestigious enterprise—a belief that could be sustained through partial perspectives produced by distance—the correspondents sent their reports and observations to London, effectively providing the Society with a blood infusion" (2006:49).In comparing the aspirations of the Royal Society with those of the Medici patrons, Biagioli argues that the Society was promoting a socio-epistemological framework for natural philosophy, not a set of specific claims or theories.1 So instead of the customized dedication of spectacular but occasional discoveries, "the Society set up a system of credit that was based on the steady flow of generic communications” (2006: 73). Geographical remoteness allowed the number of correspondents to grow without increasing personal interactions with members in London. This filter had implications for personal endorsement. Although correspondents needed to be introduced by people already known to the Society, they did not need to be gentlemen and could contribute without becoming members. Yet the same comparison that lay at the root of Galileo’s efforts resurfaces: the relation of phenomena observed to the observer's status. If the reliability of a knowledge claim was inseparable from the social qualifications of the person making it, how could the Society gain credit through reports from nongentlemen? “Correspondence did not do away with problems of credibility but reframed them within an epistolary etiquette that was necessarily different from the bodily etiquettes that regulated short-distance, face-to-face interactions among English gentlemen or Continental courtiers" (2006: 69). Correspondents sustained the Royal Society’s authority to turn reports into public knowledge. The Society had found a mode of communication that simultaneously reflected the value of interpersonal relations, and put value on their disembodied version, in circulating information whose character was from its point of view, as Biagioli aptly puts it, generic. Imaginatively incorporated into the Society thereby, correspondents were operating both “at” and "over" a distance.During the course of the English seventeenth century, associations life was acquiring its own etiquette; caught up in a new sense of purposeful association, as we have seen, the abstract connotations of "society” also refabricated older concepts such as that of “company.”® Participation was filtered: societies were known by the kinds of men (gender was invariably the first filter) they included and excluded, and had their own canons of appropriate behavior. “Early modern ‘societies’ and ‘companies' ranged from informal interactions (like men ‘making merry’ in an alehouse) to formal corporations (like the Royal Society or East India Company) with varieties of social networks and institutions in between.... [W]hile this spectrum of associational forms clearly made for an increasingly diverse range of groupings and activities, the concept of purposeful association remained remarkably stable” (Withington 2010:176; also see Dear 2001). Moreover the purpose at the center of the association would give many such entities a life that lodged in the company at large and not just at moments of meeting; that is, association-—as in the present-day literary society—worked at a distance, too.Perhaps the distance across which such interpersonal relations could be effective gave friendship some of its dimensions, even as the vehicles for these relations were changing. Galileo could call on a remote “friend” (such as Kepler) but not on the same protocols for disembodied (“generic”) information encouraged by the Royal Society.® The latter’s communications were seemingly part of an emerging associational life that afforded friends, acquaintances, and onetime strangers a purpose for thinking of themselves together. The generic idea of being in association is at once as diffuse as and no vaguer than that of relation.Biagioli’s exposition entails a comparison of comparisons (Lloyd 2015: 29). We know that the relationship (comparison) between an investigation and the authority it commanded was of lively concern to thinkers of the period (Shapin and Schaffer [1985] 2011; Shapin 1994), and Biagioli is contrasting different ways in which this was handled. One of them presaged the phasing out of that indigenous concern, as we shall see in the next chapter. Anthropologists often find themselves dealing with relations between relations as comparisons of comparisons (for an example, Descola 2001: 109; see Candea 2019). This is no more evident than in the arena of kinship and friendship, where we turn first to mainly vernacular usages and then to mainly anthropological ones.iiThe Personal and ImpersonalThe last few years have seen a steady rise in the United Kingdom among those who, whether as living or deceased donors, have contributed to organ transplantation.— For a long while, the paradigmatic transplant concerned organs from deceased persons, allocated on a need basis to strangers, as blood donation was primarily conceived between strangers (Whitfield 2013). A recent phenomenon is the increase in the proportion of living donors (of kidney, liver, and, rarely, lung). The accompanying language is illuminating. While a small number come forward for what are officially designated “non-directed,” "altruistic,” or “stranger” transplants, the majority of living transfers are “directed” to people known to the donor. The latter is translated as meaning “family and friends.”— An observer might say that the language of altruism that is so clear in the case of stranger donation becomes ambiguous when parties are known to one another; indeed, it may seem nonsense to disentangle self-interest from other-interest. Insofar as a relative is part of your family, you are simultaneously helping the relative for yourself, or for kin closer to the recipient than you are. Precisely the same could be said of friends. One guarantee of continuing relations is that reciprocities are plural and open-ended, and in these respects there is no difference between friends and relatives.12 That in the case of friends the connection coexists with these reciprocities, whereas kin relations are based on other factors as well, does not erase the similarity.This short exposition lifts the curtain on many issues involved in English-speaking understandings of kinship and friendship and their place in diverse interpersonal relations. Sentiments may be ascribed to kin and friends alike. At the same time, facilitated by the medical sub- stitutability of body parts, organ donation draws on a foundational naturalism, one that divides the diversity of social life from a continuum of human physiology and invites in the stranger. Common feelings that people recognize in one another, whether or not phrased in terms of a generalized humanity, assume similarities in a substratum of shared biology or psychology. People may naturalize concepts such as individual consciousness or expressions of aggression or sympathy toward others, even while distinguishing between their (individual) freedom of choice in seeking out friends and the givenness of the relatives to whom they are irreversibly connected. Such considerations are among the many leading to comparisons between impersonal and personal relations, and what they purportedly say about where interests lie. Anyone may be moved to help; personal knowledge is amplified by a general sense of how associates in close relationships behave.Whereas kin and friends may be considered together or apart depending on circumstance, on one specific axis—the particularistic or personal nature of association—they may be distinguished from a generalized field of impersonal relations. In their overview of a voluminous range of writings on friendship, Beer and Gardner (2015: 426) comment that, as with kin, friends not only enjoy one another's goodwill but crucially know the basis for their interaction, and each “knows that the other knows it.” This contrasts with the impersonal relations of “mere" acquaintances. That said, in the very comparison with personal relations, the concept of impersonal relations acquires its edge as not mere at all.People can move meaningfully between being impersonal and personal with one another, and in English the notion of an acquaintance may indicate someone who behaves as a bit of both (Morgan 2009). The historical sociologist Silver (1990:1476, after Georg Simmel) observes that persons are substitutable for one another in impersonal relations, by comparison with their nonsubstitutability in personal ones, prototypically between friends. It is interesting that the prototype is friendship, for kin positions would introduce ambiguities insofar as the grounds for comparison rest on differentiating the uniqueness of persons as individuals from roles (as of kinship) anyone can assume. Further ambiguity awaits. As a technical phrase, “stranger donation” refers to a living organ donor giving to a common pool, and thus in “no relation" with any potential recipient. It is a kind of collaboration between strangers, an impersonal one by contrast with collaborations between people acting out existing personal ties. The logic of the situation invites reflection back on what is happening when kin and friends are donors. Insofar as the paradigmatic organ transplant has always been transfer between strangers, perhaps we can reverse dominant vernacular usage and—in the way they act—re describe donor kin and friends as “strangers.” This would imagine them as impersonal if nonanonymous participants in today’s intimate publics, such as geographer and social theorist Amin (2012:16, 30-31) discerns in the society of strangers. A politics of care could be decentered from ideas of interpersonal or associ- ational orientations alike."Silver turns to a more ancient society of strangers, with its own particular contouring of selfinterest and disinterest.— It was "acquaintances" and “neutral strangers," “authentically indifferent co-citizens,” who peopled the then-new “strangership” of commercial society imagined by writers of the Scottish Enlightenment (1990: 1482-1483). In European history at large, the development of impersonal relations is regarded as the trademark of modernity. The familiar story dwells on a specific sphere of civil society where self-interest could flourish, impersonal relations being identified with the development of market transactions between notional strangers, explicitly removed from the restrictions of preexisting bonds once held to engage kin and friend alike. With their own ethics, envisioned as the civilities of commerce, the interests at stake were not disguised. At the same time, Silver (1990:1486) notably adds, these writers imagined this sphere precipitating its opposite, a separate domain of "personal and civic friendship.” The friendship that had formerly, and firmly, indicated common interests began to acquire the connotations of disinterested fellow-feeling. As to what counted as personal, what new sense did it acquire when private friendship became its prototype? Early modern cogitations on interpersonal relationsmight be germane to appreciating both modern and Enlightenment preoccupations, and, with the latter, some of the then-changing contours of kinship.Comparing PersonsOf diverse changes in kinship practices identified as early modern, I have speculated on whether an associational ethos was not also part of a certain generic conceptualization of kin relations. Chapter 1 observed that connotations of friendship were simultaneously undergoing metamorphosis. Up and into the seventeenth century, friend could be used of kin and non-kin alike; when it lost that kinship referent, friendship was also shorn of many of the corporeal connotations it earlier carried. "Kinship and friendship [had] turned on the same axis” (Bray 2003: 214; see Tad- mor 2001: 212). The virtue of kinship, which once Lay in the friendship that it could create, was also perhaps displaced by a new accent on personal relations of the kind that Silver describes. “Relations" became a habitual marker of kinspersons as “friends” ceased to be.An overlay that seventeenth-century English seemingly introduced was an emphasis on friendship as a matter of knowledge in the sense of recognition. It was always the case, with respect to kin, that out of “people to whom an individual is deemed related ... [are those] whom an individual chooses to acknowledge as kin at any particular moment”—and to underline the antiquity here, this comes from an account of post-Roman, early medieval, Europe (Smith 2005: 84). Indeed, the Old English term freond for "kin” is interpreted by the same writer as pointing to the kinship that made a practical difference. Interests were aligned: out of all one’s kinsmen, friends were those who could be relied on (2005: 97-98).--- Was anything changing in the way such recognition took on the characteristics of knowledge deliberately activated? Conceptualizing knowledge (knowing that you know) introduces further layers: you may know several people, near or far, but you also take care to “know” those who matter. In some seventeenthcentury milieux, one could conceivably talk of a fresh tenor to recognition. Where practices of accreditation in knowledge claims, scientific or otherwise, allowed new inflections to knowing the world around you, ever-differentiating permutations of social class created fresh occasions for filtering potential interactions, and thus for social inclusion and exclusion. Personal relations, by comparison with impersonal ones, were those you recognized.Connections amplified personal relations. Tadmor (2001: 161) refers to the eighteenth-century significance of “connections” for seeking employment and gaining preferment, not least because of the element of choice in recognition. The generic forms certainly offered possibilities for modulating the range of those one did or did not wish to acknowledge. Among the diarists on whom Tadmor draws is William Stout of Lancaster (after Marshall 1967). A “remote relation” is someone he takes on as an apprentice; the phrase “near relation" describes a nephew, while "next relation” is used of a man who inherited from his cousin. One diary entry of 1703 describes a child brought up by “some of his mother’s relations,” while another about the same time refers to someone who left his estate to his half-brother “without any respect to his father’s brother or relations” (Tadmor 2001: 124, emphasis omitted). “Stout's main point in making this [latter] utterance was to describe a case of wrongful inheritance, rather than to list all the possible kin who did not benefit from this man’s estate. In the same way, when Stout referred to the child ... [it] was not to describe the exact living arrangements, but to place the child in the context of a broader story about his mother’s imprudence and the family’s downfall” (2001: 126-127). The generic lent itself, then, to pronouncing broad judgments on the fortunes of different branches of a family or circle of connections. In turn, “having relations” pointed to an individual’s general web of kinship ties, as Tadmor puts it, and thus their attachment to a range of others, as when another diarist used the shorthand "relations” for the intimate persons who gathered at his wife’s deathbed.Persons may be compared, then, through the withholding or awarding of recognition. Discrimination on that basis had the potential to relegate a more distant sphere of personal connections to something approaching the impersonal. For where kin were specifically demarcatedby the term "relation,” they were also being rendered like everyone else of one’s circle. In that the speaker did not have to specify degree, reckoned through steps of parentage and descent, the connection was generalized. It was suggested earlier that when Galileo summoned his absent friend, he was evoking corporeal ties. Kin terms in English facilitated similar imaginings, summoning the specifics of connection (even if applied generally), “cousin” being a notable example, as well as of friendliness in acquaintance; a corporeal connection could be imagined regardless of distance. Was "relation,’’ by contrast, more evocative of a kind of knowing or acknowledgment, especially of a kind that could be accredited remotely, as in the Royal Society’s reports? With relation, kin might be recognized on the assumption that there was bound to be some link between them, but Tadmor's argument is that you did not have to specify that degree in order to "know” the person. It was enough to be in association, and to talk of close and distant relatives. As in all interpersonal relations, this sliding scale could be adjusted to substantively different circumstances, including those introduced by wealth or class. Making way for other kinds of social discriminations, the substantive content (their degree) of particular kin connections could be left undefined.Whom one recognized as kin was a question central to an anthropologically famous midtwentieth-century study undertaken in a middle-class sector of North London (Firth et al. 19 69). It exemplifies how we might grasp comparisons between persons, and particularly between kin and friends. For setting out to investigate kinship, the anthropologists found themselves talking about friendship. Their study does not just play out, in another time and space, some of the issues in knowledge-making we have been discussing, but also shows the investigators engaged in the same game.While Firth and his colleagues were clearly secure in their own usage of terms for kinship, what jumps out from their account is that they left the description of friendship largely up to their Londoners. The ethnographers go into detail on the variable ways in which people decided whether particular categories of persons counted as kin ("family,” "relatives,” "relations"). On the one hand, a single woman referred to “family" as those who are close to you, citing brothers and sisters, but it was also a term of moral responsibility and could be extended to aunts, uncles, cousins. On the other hand, there was a “secondary lot,” and she spoke of someone connected to her as "not a relation, only by marriage”; here the investigator confidently writes, "For this woman affines [in-laws] were definitely not included in the definition of ‘family’” (1969:91). The authors alluded to what was then an old debate in Anglophone anthropology (about whether affines should be included with consanguines as kin), but the point is that, within the scope of their analysis, blood kin and in-laws obviously belonged to a single conceptual universe. However, when it came to friends, not only was there no such precedent in anthropological debate, there was barely any attempt to develop an analytical position.—The trouble was, an interviewee observed, the inquiry was "all about relatives and nothing about friends” (Firth et al. 1969: 114). People themselves frequently brought friends into their responses to questions about relatives. Talking of a brother’s widow, one said, “No! She’s not a relative, she’s a friend.” The speaker’s husband put it the other way round: his wife’s brother was so close that, “yes, he was a relative... [and as for] his widow—we’ve just accepted her as a friend, as a relative ... who’s welcome in the house” (97). When people juxtaposed relatives and friends, comparison invariably concerned the quality and strength of ongoing ties. There were degrees of inclusion. One could be friendly with someone without being a friend, or a friend might be “almost one of the family”; indeed as someone said, "a close friend becomes a relative” (116). The anthropologists commented on the choice that people exercised both over who counted as kin and who counted as friend, adding, however, that this came out of the material—it was not something people stressed. Instead people spoke about the categorical contrasts that set relatives apart from friends.— Choice was seen to attach to friends, not relatives—“You can’t choose ’em, you’ve got ’em” (114). Tensions with kin were set against being able to relax with friends. Someone whose affection and sense of duty meant he kept up with parents and sisters never invitedthem to his house where friends were regularly entertained ("This is my castle and I do not want relatives in it”).Degrees of inclusion have influenced sociological as well as anthropological accounts of personal networks: indeed, we might call it a vernacular framework. Speaking generally of social relations—in which every individual is embedded—as a network, the anthropologist Boissevain (1974: 25, 47; see also Boissevain and Mitchell 1973) draws zones of intimacy as circles emanating out from a central ego. Thirty years later sociologists Spencer and Pahl (2006: 52) use a similar schema, concentric rings, in discussions with British interviewees about how they would plot people on a “personal community map.”™ This particular inquiry into the connections that people found important put friend-based and family-based networks alongside those based on neighborhood, partner, or profession. However, people’s struggles over whom to include or exclude as “family” vacillated (like the North Londoners’) between whether categorical or effective relations were at stake. Down to the same adage apropos being able to choose friends but not kin, individual designations of friends and family nonetheless overlapped, with this or that person "more friend-like,” “more family-like” (2006:114).The comparisons these indigenous moderns make between individuals within their personal networks betray a consistently affective overlay to the categories they use. This is especially clear when—faced with a researcher’s questions—they have to make choices in the abstract, and at issue is closeness and distance. Closeness has resonances of affective, and the effective expression of, attachment. Thinking of an individual friend as "family” may make the friend closer, while thinking of a relative as a "friend” may make the relative closer. Stressing contrast or opposition between friends and family conversely evokes detachment. Comparisons can also be expressed in terms of who is a "real” or “true” friend or relative, which bears on a local theory of sorts, namely that concepts have core meanings extendible beyond their original connotations, or can be applied as metaphors or similes (friend-like, family-Zifee). If pressed, many moderns would no doubt regard the terminology of paternal relations in a church, or of fraternal ones in a trade union, as figures of speech.”An implicit framework for making comparisons, seemingly laid down in certain early modern practices, appears clearly outlined in these latter-day usages. (1) Comparison appears as a matter of degree, whether the degree turns on distance, social and otherwise, or—with affective or evaluative resonance—on how far persons “really” fit a category, and thus live up to expectations. (2) Comparison allows a distribution of characteristics or attributes across designations for persons, the characteristics simultaneously having their own values, such as value placed on the given or the chosen, and deriving from conventions associated with specific roles, such as friends are friendly, in-laws awkward. (3) Above all, comparison includes people in and excludes them from specific categories (regardless of whether the categories overlap, are context-dependent, and so forth); a category is self-evidently composed of entities that share similar features (the criterion of inclusion), by contrast with entities that are differentiated (a criterion for exclusion). Categorization can proceed without remark, but it can also entail self-consciousness in the way people think about the implications of comparing kin and friends.In short, these modern connotations of comparison emerge with contours prefigured in earlier concerns about knowledge. Describing this epistemic relation thus serves as a bridgehead to explicit anthropological comparisons of friends and kin (Firth and his colleagues stumbled into the field inadvertently); some anthropological accounts seem like veritable echo chambers of this vernacular framework.HIComparisons of Comparisons—1In common usage the connotations of “kin” and “friend" are clearly situational, as we have just seen, giving rise to overlapping possibilities. So what are English-speaking (-writing) anthropologists going to make of kin and friends elsewhere? While expositions of kinship may have little to say about friendship, anthropological attention to friendship invariably deals with kinship. Across social formations, this becomes a veritable comparison of comparisons. Three edited collections give us a foothold for discussion, the first (Leyton 1974a) produced in the wake of the then-new social network analysis, followed by Bell and Coleman (1999) criticizing the notion that global transformations were creating a ubiquitous understanding of friendship, and most recently Guichard and colleagues (2014), whose agenda is to resituate friendship apropos kinship.13 Beer and Gardner point to a voiced fear that kinship studies might engulf the sphere of friendship, so that empirically distinct ways of being friends become lost to comparative analysis.—Resonating with the positive connotations of closeness already encountered, some anthropologists stress that the very concept of friendship implies an idealized form of itself (“true” friendship) (e.g., Paine 1999). Thus Carrier (1999: 21) forthrightly defines friendship as a relation "based on spontaneous and unconstrained sentiment or affection,” and immediately sets up a contrast: “After all, if the relationship is constrained we confront something very different from what we call ‘friendship,’ something [more] like bureaucratic relationships, kinship relationships or patron-client relationships.” His "we" occupies the specific vantage point of "Western thought," so he is problematizing this concept of friendship through a comparative move. Like Paine (1999: 39), Carrier argues that we cannot understand conceptions of friendship without understanding conceptions of self and person. Not only is there a history to Western usage, and diversity between segments of the population, there is also evidence of very differently constituted "social selves" in other regimes, where people's notions of self mean they are unlikely to think of friendship “in the modem Western sense” (1999: 35). The possibilities range from the shock of an anthropologist returning to her native Brazil to hear everyone calling all kinds of people “friends" when it had such a narrow social usage in the England from which she had come (Rezende 1999), to a study of networks in China where fewer than 7 percent of named people were described as friends by contrast with a reported almost 70 percent in the United States (Smart 1999:119).—Nonetheless, in pursuit of kinship and friendship across diverse locales, a recurrent set of contrasting attributes orients anthropological comparison: formal/informal, public/private, im- mutable/variable, involuntary/elective, specialized/unspecialized, consfrained/free from constraint, and so forth. The contrasts hold implications for social action; they also imply theoretical sensitivity to what is relevant to social analysis. Thus kinship may be presented as "central" to friendship’s “peripheral" location, or a matter of "societal” as opposed to “personal” relations.A complaint about such models motivates Guichard's collection on sub-Saharan Africa. If friendship outside “Western" countries is still understudied, that is because of the "premise that the room left for friendship to flourish as an extra-kin relationship is inversely proportional to the importance of kinship as a factor structuring community” (2014: 1). Far from staking out a distinct terrain for friendship, she wants to bring kinship back in. Studying the one apart from the other, she argues, ignores the extent to which friendship is so often an ideal model for relations between kin, as it ignores just how friendship is frequently transformed into kinship (for example, through marriage alliances). Among the contributors to the same book, Werbner (2014: 143) concludes, apropos urban Gaborone in Botswana, that "both the urban friendship circle and boon-companionship mesh durably with kinship, and do not displace it, or take any load or emotional charge from it." However, compared to kinship, such friendship is narrowly defined along gender and class lines and restricted to same-generation associates.— Warms (2014: 120), speaking of merchants in Mali, argues that in modern African cities "kinship and friendship may reinforce one another." There need be no inverse relationship between the demands of kin and friend; that notion has only become “commonsensical in our own society” (120) because of the modernist myth—a self-conscious “vision of Western society,” inWarms’s phrase—that as people leave “tight knit” village communities bound by formal ties of kinship they make informal, voluntary associations in town.In the anthropological effort to make “friend” work as an analytical category alongside “kin," there seems no case that does not have a range of ethnographic variations. People may agree on a line between friends and acquaintances, but you cannot use the terms in present-day Finland as you would in England (Abrahams 1999). In rural Lesotho half a century ago (Wallman 1974), while you would be aware of the prevalence of kin terms for all manner of local and political relations, when kin help one another in everyday affairs they are not necessarily doing so as kinsmen; kinship may be significant, irrelevant, or avoided for the task in hand. Nonetheless what for much of the twentieth century made the anthropological accounts comparable was the knowledge that such variation was no more nor less than any cross-societal or cross-cultural comparison was bound to yield. Comparison, elaborating on local attributions of dispositions and habits to this or that kind of person, assumed that there was a systemic description to be given of the society or culture in question. One sign of the systemic was that such a description axiomatically accounted for internal variation: insofar as the whole could be framed comparatively, so, too, could each detail or part.This possibility was underlined by anthropological disagreement as to what that whole might be. The positions adopted in the 1970s by Paine (1974a, [1969] 1974b), who worked with largely European materials, and by Schwimmer (1974), on Oceania, are instructive. Drawing on the (vernacular) middle-class culture “of our own society," Paine argues that friendship is a phenomenon restricted to certain social configurations characterized by autonomy, unpredictability, and terminality in which the intimate and the private play important roles. It is “a sociological and cultural device [in the management of interpersonal relations] in respect to which there exist different alternatives” in other societies ([1969] 1974b: 119). Taking issue with this, Schwimmer (1974: 49) focuses on the potential universality of a “type of association which is initiated by mutual attraction and which is maintained by the exchange of intrinsic benefits." Across Oceania, such “friendship" may seem at first sight residual to affective relations between kin, but the theoretical justification for paying it attention is whether "our analysis is able to reveal in it a structural principle" (51). In effect, both anthropologists reiterate a founding assumption of comparative endeavor: exploring these interrelations was the means and ends of social inquiry.Degree of fit, distribution of characteristics, categorization on the basis of similarity and difference—the debates offer a parallel with those vernacular (English) connotations of comparison elucidated in the conduct of Firth’s London study. To these connotations, twentieth-century anthropologists added a further crucial dimension. What above all organizes the elements of a comparison are models of social or cultural life; being explicit about this organization is the anthropologist’s principal self-conscious move. Hence models can compete with one another over what should be reckoned (say) a structural matter. When Paine ([1969] 1974b: 120) appropriates a comment on ritual kinship and applies it to friendship—in many situations, friendship “avoids being implicated in the internal dimensions of the kinship structure, for it involves no structural issues (Pitt-Rivers 1968: 412)”—he intends "social structure" in the Anglophone sense. When Schwimmer (19 74:51) uncovers a whole friendship universe and its internal categorizations as a result of structural analysis, he intends something closer to the Francophone inflection of “structuralism.” However, this comparison was never labeled as such. Rather, the explicit relationship between these two analytical procedures invariably appears as ethnographic expertise: which argument seems to make best sense (closest fit) of the particular data each has to hand. Whether models of organization or the organization of models, in these twentieth-century materials at least, organization there always is. The goal is a systemic account.Detecting parallels between the coherence of anthropological analysis and the coherence of the anthropologist’s subject matter became increasingly subject to critical reflection over the latter part of the twentieth century. It augmented self-consciousness about knowledge-making, which the very idea of an analytical vocabulary had always entailed. Comparisons of Comparisons—2Paine and Schwimmer seem equally captivated by Aristotle’s Nicomachean ethics. By no means the first or last anthropologists to have commented on its discussion of “the distinctive friendship of kinship" (notably Sahlins 2008: 45-46; 2013: 20; and, via Thomas Aquinas, Fortes 1969: 23 9n), each takes up Aristotle’s contrast between ties combining pleasantness and usefulness with the goodness of perfect friendship and those showing only some of these components. They then diverge. Paine (1974a) pursues the moral content of these concepts as a measure against which to assess modem anthropological writings on friendship. Matters of enduring concern since the beginning of social science, equality, solidarity, and instrumentalism in people's relations with one another all come to the fore. Schwimmer (1974) goes for the overarching term philia. Focusing on this Greek concept of friendship that embraces both kin and non-kin, he adopts it as an analytical category. Yet this deliberate departure from English word usage opens up rather than closes down need for further exposition.One sign of the 1970s interest in friendship was a semipopular account written by Brain (1976). Opening up to a general English readership the varieties of relations in which people express love for one another, manifested above all in friendship, it is with intent to surprise that he discusses “kinship and marriage” in the Papua New Guinea highlands. Referring to the Kuma of the Middle Wahgi Valley, Brain speaks of how special the brother-in-law relation is to male friendship—men explain they marry women in order to have the women’s brothers as their friends. Indeed, the “relationship between brothers-in-law is the only one in which friendships can develop in a way which renders personal devotion ... crucial in determining the actions of one man towards another” (1976: 172). Emphasizing the easygoing nature of this tie, he observes that unrelated friends call each other—compare themselves with—“brothers-in-law.”A comparison with the Bangwa of the African. Cameroon mobilizes their comparison between a husband’s relations with his spouse’s legal guardian (marriage lord) and those he enjoys with her brothers and other in-laws. Brothers-in-law are notably relaxed with one another, free of the suspicions of witchcraft or sorcery that affect so many other relations. Bangwa can marry (“fairly close”) patrilineal kin, converting them into affines; yet insofar as affines are sought after as a "means of making new friendships” (Brain 19 76:174), replicating marriages between people already so linked is then forbidden. This protocol reverses both the Kuma preference, which is to concentrate marriages between friendly clans who are also military allies (Reay 1959a), and those of their highlands neighbors where intermarrying clans are either out-and-out enemies to one another or else are sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile. (When enemies are affines, enmity operates largely at clan level, the personal relations of in-laws being notionally protected.) Note the shift in the anthropologists’ comparisons. No longer comparing “friends” with "family” or "kin,” they are now differentiating kinds of kin relations from one another.Schwimmer (1974: 51) does just this in his observations on philia. The purpose of the analytical category is to illuminate structural principles governing the recognition of friendship. Drawing on his work in lowland Papua New Guinea, he describes how Orokaiva institutionalize friendship through reference to three modalities (modes of interaction) in kin relations. These can be compared as: (1) cooperative alliance, centered on sibling and parental bonds; (2) competitive group exchange, especially with affines and maternal kin; (3) and the interdependence found between spouses or between cross-cousins (cousins linked through opposite-sex siblings). Within each modality, same or similar terms occur for both kin and non-kin friends. Thus structured, friends are distinguished according to the same criteria as kin are; as a consequence different categories of friends cannot be reduced to one another. Where Bangwa suggest that friendship differentiates kinds of kin, here Orokaiva inform us that kin can differentiate kinds of friends. In turn, Schwimmer’s focus on friends affects what he had previously taken for granted as a kin universe. Friendship now “becomes a dynamic dimension of kinship” (1974: 57), and he speaks of aphiliauniverse. Applicable to any consideration of kinship and friendship, such a universe turns on permutations of identification and differentiation, yielding four organizational possibilities, in which the distribution of designations becomes a matter for empirical inquiry.24 Thus there may be complete overlap between designations of kin and friend or no overlap at all. In twisting his language with that Greek term, Schwimmer tells us he was deliberately making use of an unfamiliar concept. He needed to name what he took as “a universal type of association,” one characterized by the exchange of benefits arising largely out of the association itself. Yet what enables Schwimmer to make various comparisons across societies contains an interesting assumption. His Orokaivan example of philia relations is structured by those three modalities of interaction (alliance, exchange, or interdependence); rather more than the mutual alignments that Beer and Gardner (2015) see intrinsic to friendship in Aristotle’s sense, for Orokaiva—and for Papua New Guinea at large—a whole cosmology is inscribed in "the exchange of benefits.” Brain might say that Kuma brothers-in-law can show devotion not based on material interests, but that would leave out the critical exchange on which their very relation is (materially) based: the marriage of the woman who faces the one as sister and the other as wife.—If comparison encourages expository neologisms, such as philia relations, it also circumscribes other descriptions. In a Papua New Guinean context, introducing the Euro-American comparison of kin and friends in terms of interest and disinterest would yield little. It is pointless to expect an absence of material interest. Relations of all kinds are made material—it is the equivalent of being recognized. The influence that persons have on one another may be mediated (through gifts, say) or unmediated (a capacity to effect health or harm), but it makes no sense to imagine the materiality of that influence as a matter of choice.— The woman between the two men, and the substantial consequences flowing from this, is reason enough why the Kuma brother-in-law relationship is an interested one, regardless of how it is implemented. In Schwim- mer's view, it is the imperative nature of kinship bonds that makes them appropriate expressions of mutuality for certain kinds of unrelated friends.Exposition demands looking again at the concept of exchange. Men’s difference from each other is an outcome of the relations linking them; otherwise put, they interact by virtue of the distinctions between them. What brothers-in-law exchange is the perspective each has on the wife/sister: she divides the men. One view is thus acknowledged in the other, a nonreversible relation between specific partners, which may for Kuma and their neighbors be explicitly transformed into the reversible ceremonial positions of givers and receivers of wealth. A woman, too, turns in two directions: in the Papua New Guinea highlands (there are other versions), the husband elicits her productive and reproductive capacities for his and his son’s clan, not for that of her father and brother. Without those two sets of kin—conjugal and natal—being held in an ongoing interchange, a woman’s capacity for social action is diminished. It is here that degrees of expectation become highly relevant, judgments are made about the satisfaction with which male affines conduct their affairs, and the health of the woman and her progeny become a vital measure of the state of their relations.It is hard to resist the conclusion from this Papua New Guinean (and Cameroonian) excursus that people are "comparing” certain relations with other relations. Yet what is captured in the observer’s notion of comparison? Schwimmer’s linguistic intervention reminds us how anthropologists may have to navigate the language of exposition. The materials, from Melanesia at least, make some rather less obvious points, which are worth spelling out.Comparing RelationsDegree of fit, distribution of characteristics, categorization on the basis of similarity and difference: I suggested that these elements of twentieth-century anthropological models of comparison ran alongside certain vernacular (English-speaking) practices. They do so together with the additional self-consciousness of investigating the roles played by society or culture, and (so it was noted) their rendering as specific structures or systems. With the vernacular connection, itis not too far-fetched to ask if there might be counterparts to these elements in the comparison of relations suggested by aspects of (say) Melanesian kinship, especially given the tenor of marriage exchange.—For here we seem to be dealing with a calculus of sorts. Relations give perspectives on other relations. Where a wife is marked as a brother-in-law’s sister, my relation with her (man-speaking) is like your relation with her, though the terms to the relation (spouse/sibling) are different; my relation is unlike yours, though the woman is the same woman. At least, that is how one might write out a comparison of such relations in English, rendering similarity and difference the crucial operators. Yet, in Melanesian (so to speak), the two sets of relations (spouses/in-laws) are neither merged into each other nor opposed, and their parallelism is of a rather particular kind. Between the men, each side of a reciprocal relationship already incorporates the corresponding perspective. The above statement would need rewriting: “My relation with her is [defined by/div- ided from] your relation with her.” This is not readily encompassed by a vocabulary that turns on similarity and difference. Let us break this observation down through the elements of comparison already laid out.First, although what we might call degree of relating is found in greater or lesser extent in the way particular brothers-in-law deal with one another, the relation as such is not made present to such and such degree through individual personal enactments. Rather it is regarded as held— whether in place or in abeyance—by all the relations around, for example through the (marriage) exchange that has already reconfigured their kin networks. This bears, second, on the distribution of characteristics. Marriages, like deaths, are critical moments in the rearrangement of, well, anthropologists might say social life, but their interlocutors might say flows of procreative potential or some such. While these kin categories can provide the anthropologist with schemas of social classification based on attributes and characteristics, what is probably at issue for the parties themselves will be something closer to capacity or efficacy such as is manifest in wellbeing. From this comes the third point. These categories are about the vital influence persons have on one another. To conceptualize a (non-kin) friend as a brother-in-law is to acknowledge the material consequences of the relationship for each other’s fortunes. Otherwise put, the relationship has brother-in-law-ish outcomes: it is the relation that is the value-bearing entity. In sum, English speakers could indeed find counterparts to various elements of their concept of comparison, while at the same time these counterparts add up to nothing like the comparison of similarities and differences as they know it. The final question is whether there is any counterpart to the anthropologist’s self-conscious organization (structural, systemic) of items laid out to be compared. This requires lengthier treatment.When Schwimmer refers to Orokaivan brothers-in-law belonging to a mode of kin relating through which people also conceptualize friends, he detects a formality in the allocation of friendship relations. Apart from the extent to which they engage in competitive, reciprocating partnerships, these brothers-in-law work under the constraints that all affinal transactions entail. Other relations in the philia system, cooperative alliance and unions based on interdependence, also demand the observance of etiquette. Insofar as these relations are bound up with specific modes of interaction, then perhaps acting out such specificities constitutes something like a meta-discursive commentary, and thus self-conscious reflection, on what relations mean to people.The most important form of Orokaivan hereditary friendship, that of "cooperative alliance” (it has a special term), includes sharing between siblings. It may draw in previously unrelated persons such as the in-married wives of a village. Not connected among themselves before arriving there, women will establish specific bonds with one another, creating occasions for visits and gifting between villages. In turn, men who establish hereditary friendships based on cooperative alliance call each other brother; if they do not live nearby, they nonetheless conduct their gift giving not with the expectations of reciprocating partners but in the idiom of sharing. Again, it is the relation that stamps its value on the transaction. Thus a host shares with hisbrother when the latter comes to visit; on the obligatory return visit, the erstwhile guest now shares in likewise manner. Staged interchanges are signifying events (Stasch 2009:17), making explicit the displacement or substitution of people’s perspective on others, sequenced through time and space.Reflective as one might understand such formal categorizations to be, acknowledging the effects persons have on one another, one can still ask whether this explicitness implies anything like the self-consciousness of an anthropological comparison. To look for counterparts to metadiscourse, Euro-American observers would no doubt investigate indigenous knowledge practices and their accessibility to the thinking self. But suppose they were trying to describe a world where nothing present announces what it otherwise (“really”) is, and where the idea that you learn by looking would strike people as extraordinary, for you wait on what the future will tell —an inscrutability as true of your state of relations with kin and friends as of anything else.— Between an enactment and the interpretation of it, time must lapse; past events, including how persons impinge upon one another, are “known” through their subsequent effects. (Your previous hospitality to friends is measured by, exchanged with, their hospitality to yourself.) Nothing passive is implied about waiting on the future (Rollason 2014): Melanesians spend much time trying to bring revelation forward, whether one is talking of now-abandoned practices of divination or of the speeding up of exchanges, as Pickles (2014) has described for the highlands town of Goroka through the medium of card games. Players regard the games as engaging different speeds, slow and fast, and he argues that they offer an analytical device for reflection on social change (where “fast” relations tend to overtake the "slow”). Ceremonial exchanges and card games alike "encourage people to think analytically and reflectively about their past and future efforts" (2014:278).-Perhaps the kind of self-consciousness at issue may be addressed through another twist to language. In discussing how Melanesian ethnographers have often recorded the personal hospitality they have received, Wagner (2012; also see 2001) observes that hospitality is invariably impersonated in such narratives but not “expersonated." Too narrowly rendered, it is not given a larger concretivity in how those narratives are organized. The former term is familiar enough; the latter demands, precisely, exposition. In ordinary usage, impersonation exaggerates or neglects particular features of its subject in copying ("abstracting”) it, while the extraordinary term expersonation “registers more concrete particularity than is found in the original.... Hence an impersonation involves all those actions in which a subject mimes him- or herself as an individual character or personality, whereas an expersonation is something like a professional monograph, in which the author’s selfness is devoted to a totally objective personality profile in which they imitate the predilections of others” (2012: si 62). While he gives several examples, I keep with this initial “Euro-American" one of the monograph. Jumping off from that enables critical purchase on the concept of self-consciousness.If self-consciousness, as moderns commonly understand it, is a version of the quintessential impersonation of a subject as a self, then it entails self-reflection, this being a form of (self-)objectification through imagining one’s self among or from the perspective of others. A Melanesian moment of expersonation affords a counterpart of sorts to that impersonated selfconsciousness, although it need not turn on any prior determination of what is "inside” or “outside” a person.—The moment in question locates persons through an encompassing field of diverse and specific interchanges. An expersonated “self-consciousness inheres in the way the relations are acted out. Others are in this sense known reflexively, that is, through what happens to the self. Thus Stasch (2009:102,170) talks of the “reflexive sensibility” about or toward social relations— whether as matters of attraction or repulsion—on which the Korowai of West Papua frequently dwell. Perhaps those Orokaivan forms of interaction could be described as expersonating the selves of the brothers or brothers-in-law or in-married wives as they appear over the span of multiple relationships. Certainly we may ponder the explicit emphasis, to that extent "self-conscious, that such people give to the appropriate acting out of relational imperatives. Impersonation, by contrast, might appropriately describe the embodiment of life-force or ancestral power (imitating/being one’s own ancestor).A common feature of anthropologists' engagement with their materials is that concepts imported for one purpose may be exported with new resonances for another. It would not seem unreasonable to lift, from the discussion of the perspectives that Melanesian kin relations give one another, the idea that each pole incorporates the other’s perspective and apply the idea to the reciprocities of Anglophone kin reckoning; it would, however, be necessary to add that this is not what English usage dwells on. However, I see a promising export in the concept of expersonation, retaining its original conjunction with the impersonation of a subject as a self. What began with Wagner’s homely example can be augmented with something learned from this Melanesian moment.Consider again how, over the English seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a freshly minted axis of comparison between kin and friends comes into circulation: self-interest and disinterest, and its interplay with what is or is not instrumentalized.” Enlightenment writers contrasted a burgeoning commercial society with a precommercial society that could offer no possibility of disinterested relations. "The Scots’ theoretical project required an enlarged domain of indifferent persons available for market exchanges and contractual engagements,” specifically separate from what "was unoriginal at the time and later became a cliche: the individual together with close family and friends in the innermost of concentric circles" (Silver 1990: 1491). Cliche though it might be, we can give this self-description of the modern self a twist. Suppose what is being described is none other than the condition under which aspects of the person appear expersonated, namely as a ubiquitous field of commerce, among whose anonymous dealers individuals are generically motivated by self-interest or instrumentalism. Conversely the impersonated self is recognizable in private lives, in which personalized sentiment is played out in a "self-less” and in that sense disinterested way between consociates, leading to those accounts of friendship that insist there is nothing comparable in societies untouched by modernity. In short, the friend (modern-style) becomes an apt impersonation of "personal” ties. Or, to restore the vernacular, friendship “serves as a prototype of the larger category of personal relations" (1990: 1475). Conceivably, that is what some of Firth’s Londoners assumed the anthropologists were investigating.Under these conditions, “interpersonal relations” emerge as a distinct sphere of social life, in form a bit like a philia universe.™ It is divided between the personal and impersonal—the existence of a dispassionate bureaucracy allows friendship to flourish without institutionalization (Paine [1969] 1974b: 137). At work is what Schwimmer might identify as a structural principle: personal relations take an oppositional form precisely with respect to impersonal ones. As we have heard, "[only] with impersonal markets in products and services does a parallel system of personal relations emerge whose ethic excludes exchange and utility” (Silver 1990: 1494). In Beer and Gardner’s (2015: 425) view, a scholarly triptych centers the comparative exposition of friendship between two wings: “Key features of friendship (its ’private nature,’ 'voluntarism’ and 'individualism’) mean that it has in large part been constituted by its juxtaposition with, on the one hand, the affective but ‘obligatory’ relations of the kin domain, and, on the other, those impersonal relations that constitute the broader institutional order of modernity.”
