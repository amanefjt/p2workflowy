INTRODUCTION
Thinking through things
Amiria Henare, Martin Holbraad and Sari Wastell
What would an artefact-oriented anthropology look like if it were not about material culture? And could such a project develop, not as a new sub-genre within the discipline, but as a means of reconfiguring anthropology's analytic methods more generally? These are questions that preoccupy the contributors to this volume, all of whom share common concerns about the place of objects and materiality in their analytical strategies. Living in places where powder is power, where costumes allow access to other planes of existence, and where legal documents may not primarily concern reason or argument, ethnographers are obliged to question the assumptions underpinning their own surprise at such things. Rather than dismiss informants' accounts as imaginative 'interpretations' - elaborate metaphorical accounts of a 'reality' that is already given - anthropologists might instead seize on these engagements as opportunities from which novel theoretical understandings can emerge. The goal of this volume is to gather a range of approaches that show how such moments of ethnographic 'revelation' - in which unanticipated, previously inconceivable things become apparent - may be taken seriously in anthropological discourse. In particular, how and to what degree might the artefacts that so often occasion these moments be engaged with on their own terms? Too often, perhaps, the anthropologist's immediate reaction is to explain away their own surprise with recourse to more familiar conceptions - not least the presupposition that these artefacts are analytically separable from the significance informants seem to 'attach' to them. What would happen, we ask, if this wonderment were held in a state of suspension so as to resist the urge to explain it away? The idea is to develop a language for writing and speaking about ethnographic experience that unsettles distinctions central to the very origins of the discipline, the tools which underpin the work of anthropological explanation.
At least since W H. R. Rivers declared in 1914 that 'the whole movement of interest' in anthropology is 'away from the physical and material towards the psychological and social', anthropologists, even while working to undermine such distinctions, have tended ultimately to reiterate them. Oppositionsbetween the concrete and the abstract, the physical and the mental, the material and the social have thus endured, becoming hegemonic in the strict sense, in that efforts to overcome them have often contributed to their reproduction (cf Argyrou 2002: 2-6). Even scholars dedicated to re-integrating materiality and culture in response to the Riversian (and earlier Cartesian) segregation continue to struggle with theoretical languages that presume an a priori distinction between persons and things, matter and meaning, representation and reality Like the modish notion of 'hybridity', the impetus toward reconnection turns on the presumption of an initial separation.
Such presumptions are, of course, what many working in the field of material culture studies have attempted to overcome by employing theoretical strategies as diverse as phenomenology, cognitive psychology and Marxist analyses of fetishism (see e.g. Ingold 2000; Kuchler 2005; Spyer 1998). By positing the relationship between human subjects and the objects they create as mutually constitutive, for example, scholars like Daniel Miller have sought to retrain anthropology's analytic gaze away from an exclusive focus on the social, toward the materiality of social life (Miller 1987; 2005a). The focus of this book, by contrast, cuts a rather different tranche through the philosophical territory approached by such analyses. Being concerned less with the ways in which subjects and objects emerge, or with questions of materiality, it turns attention rather to the relationship between concepts and things in a way that questions whether these ought necessarily be considered as distinct in the first place. The distinction between concepts and things (which broadly compasses other familiar dichotomies such as sense versus reference, signified versus signifier, etc.) may be unhelpful, obscuring theoretical possibilities that might arise were the pre-emption of such contrasts by the artefacts we study taken seriously By confirming the authority of formulations peculiar to Euro-American philosophical traditions, recourse to familiar analytical concepts can inhibit effective engagement between researchers and the phenomena they study
The purpose of this introduction is to elucidate what the editors see as implicit in the contributions to this volume. While the contributors were not asked to write to a specific remit, we see in their papers a variety of attempts to sidestep habitual analytic distinctions. Instead of advancing yet more complex and ostensibly sophisticated theoretical models (piling up the assumptions as it were), each explores the peculiar mileage afforded by the ethnographic method itself What they offer collectively is the promise of a new way of approaching the often-segregated tasks of fieldwork and analysis, in short, the germ of a new methodology. With purposeful naivete, the aim of this method is to take 'things' encountered in the field as they present themselves, rather than immediately assuming that they signify, represent, or stand for something else. Adopting an approach that might be called 'radically essentialist' (see below), the papers that have been assembled here can be seen as exploring a more open, heuristic approach to analysis that allows'things', as and when they arise, to offer theoretical possibilities (and it will presently be explained why the term 'things' is considered apposite in this context).
Things as meanings
It remains a commonplace within anthropology and related disciplines that meanings can only be thought of as abstractions - ideas that somehow circulate in the ether, over a material substrate primordially devoid of significance. 'Understood as a realm of discourse, meaning and value', Tim Ingold has observed, 'culture is conceived to hover over the material world but not to permeate it' (2000: 340). On this model, meanings attach to things, impose themselves on things, may even be inscribed or embodied in certain things, but are always presumed to be - in the first instance - distinct from the things themselves. Marilyn Strathem (1990) has attributed this view to the epistemological preoccupations of a modernist anthropology that takes as its task the elucidation of social and cultural 'contexts, 一 systems or frameworks used to make sense of social life (see also Pinney and Thomas 2001).In this scheme, she notes, the primary task of anthropologists is to slot things into the social and historical systems (such as 'society' or 'culture') wherein their significance is produced. One effect of this procedure is that the system itself becomes the object of study, its artefacts reduced to mere illustration:
For if one sets up social context as the frame of reference in relation to which meanings are to be elucidated, [. . .] then explicating that frame of reference obviates or renders the illustrations superfluous: they are become exemplars or reflections of meanings which are produced elsewhere. It was in this sense that social anthropology could proceed independently of the study of material culture.
(Strathem 1990: 38)1
This volume is designed to test the limits of such enduring analytical assumptions. Rather than accepting that meanings are fundamentally separate from their material manifestations (signifier v. signified, word v. referent, etc.), the aim is to explore the consequences of an apparently counter-intuitive possibility: that things might be treated as sui generis meanings. Such a formulation will appear paradoxical only to those who see the anthropologist's task as one of putting things into context (which of course turns precisely on the distinctions we seek to overcome). So the starting-point instead is to treat meaning and thing as an identity - and if the Aristotelian notion of essence was meant to allow things to carry their definitive properties on their sleeve, then the essentialism entertained here is indeed radical. For in the image put forward, meanings are not 'carried' by things but justare identical to them. Such a starting-point neutralises the question of 'knowledge' at the outset, because meanings - be they native (relativism) or supra-cultural (universalism) - no longer need to 'be excavated, illuminated, decoded and interpreted. What is proposed, in effect, is an anthropology that holds issues of interpretation at bay. The point is not that anthropologists might be wrong (or indeed unique) in their predilection for structuring the world according to proverbial 'binary oppositions', but simply that such notions are not universally shared (even within 'the West'), and therefore may not be particularly useful as a lens through which to view other peoples' lives and ideas. Indeed, the strategy of refusing to apportion meanings and things separately - of taking them as one - provides a way out of such familiar anthropological dilemmas. For it focuses attention away from the business of adjudicating between competing 'theories' that may be more or less appropriate to ethnographic material, toward that of articulating a method by which the material may itself enunciate meanings.
What things?
The project, then, is primarily methodological. It encourages anthropologists to attend to 'things' as they emerge in diverse ethnographic settings, and to begin such investigations with what, for the ethnographer, may appear as a logical reversal: rather than providing data to which theory is applied, revealing the strengths and flaws of an existing theoretical model, the things encountered in fieldwork are allowed to dictate the terms of their own analysis 一 including new premises altogether for theory In this sense, of course, the project is not new. The promise of methodologies that 'think through things' has long 'been implicit in the ethnographic method itself, with its imperative to go out and 'see for oneself' and to participate in, as well as observe, other peoples' lives. Ethnographic fieldwork compels its practitioners to engage with people and their things in a variety of ways, not simply by talking to them or reading about them in their own or others' texts. Anthropologists prepare and share food with their informants, help to build houses and participate in producing all manner of artefacts, from blowpipes to photographic records to legal claims. So the injunction to let these interactions speak for themselves is not an innovation. What the approach advanced here attempts to add to these routine activities is a collapse of the experience/analysis divide, such that the experience of things in the field is already an encounter; simpliciter, with meanings.
But first, why 'things' at all, and why an 'artefact-oriented' anthropology? At first glance it might appear that this terminology upholds the very oppositions we are calling into question (sociality v. materiality, culture v. nature, meanings v. things). The prescription to think through things would appear to require a clarification as to what may count as a thing in the first place. Such a clarification, however, is one which we are not just reluctant, butpatently committed, to denying the reader. Things, it is suggested, ought not to be delineated in advance of the ethnographic encounters from which they emerge. To pre-empt an ethnographically defined understanding of what constitutes a thing would be to simply offer an alternative theory of things.
^hing-as-heuristic9 v. (thing-as-analytic9
The advantage of 'things' as a term is that, unlike 'objects', 'artefacts' and 'materiality', they carry minimal theoretical baggage. The term is, as Levi- Strauss' point about true and machin as 'floating signifiers' would suggest, distinguished by its peculiar vacuity (Levi-Strauss 1987: 55, and see Holbraad, this volume) - though we would of course retort that even calling the term 'thing' a 'signifier', floating or otherwise, freights it with particular theoretical weight. The denuded usage of 'things' put forward in this volume is thus intended to signal a shift in the term's status - described here as a transformation of 'thing-as-analytic' to 'thing-as-heuristic'. Rather than going into the field armed with a set of pre-determined theoretical criteria against which to measure the 'things' one already anticipates might be encountered, it is proposed that the 'things' that present themselves be allowed to serve as a heuristic with which a particular field of phenomena can be identified, which only then engender theory So, the difference between an analytic and a heuristic use of the term 'things' is that while the former implies a classificatory repertoire intended for refinement and expansion, the latter serves to carve out things (as an appropriately empty synonym for 'objects' or 'artefacts') as the field from which such repertoires might emerge. Analytics parse, heuristics merely locate.2
Take Holbraad's contribution as an example. The thing through which he sets out to think is ache, a particular kind of powder Cuban diviners use during their seances. This powder, the diviners say, constitutes their divina- tory power. Now, if one were to take this powder as a 'thing' in the analytic sense, the ethnographer would have to devise a connection between two distinct entities (powder and power), only one of which appears as 'obviously' thing-like, according to their pre-conceived notion of 'things'. The task then becomes one of interpretation - explaining to those who have not encountered such a 'thing' before how it can be considered powerful (given that the 'things' we know do not exercise power in and of themselves) and how power itself may be considered a (powdery) thing - a strategy which not only presumes the reader's familiarity with the concepts being deployed, but insists upon their authority as an accurate account of reality 'They' believe the powder is power, 'we' know that this belief derives from a peculiar cultural logic in which powerful powder makes sense. What remains undeveloped (or even precluded) in this scheme are the theoretical possibilities afforded by powerful powder itself Where one recognises the 'thing-ness' of powder in heuristic terms, on the other hand, the connection with power is already immanent in the powder (the thing is both powder and power and is accepted as such). The task tor the ethnographer, then, is not to explain how certain people might counterintuitively connect powder with power, contrary to his own presumption that only one of them (powder) can properly be considered a thing. After all, his informants attest that this powder does not just happen to be powerful, but is power. This begs the question of how an adequate account of this 'thing' can be achieved. Instead of seeing this as a problem of interpretation, that is, of expanding familiar categories to illuminate unfamiliar instances, we suggest that it might rather be treated as one of assembling a satisfactory description - if it seems odd that powder should be power, the problem is 'ours' and not 'theirs'. But crucially, such a task involves a further move. Having accepted powder as power, and allowed others to approach its unfamiliar contours through skilful description, the ethnographer is then obliged to deal with the theoretical implications of this heuristic engagement. One possibility, undertaken here, is to use the ethnographic analysis of powder as an occasion to advance a theory that refuses the dichotomy between materiality and power in the first place. The scheme of classification appropriate to the analysis of powder is thus no longer a pre-condition of the analytical strategy, 'but its product.
So in summary, behind the hope that an ethnography of things may lead to a revision of our analytical assumptions about what counts as a 'thing' lies the possibility that those assumptions may be inappropriate, and that other people's understandings on this score (including not just their ideas about things but also their assumptions) might be different from what we take to be our own when writing anthropologically. The heuristic approach advocated here seeks to animate these possibilities.
A heuristic use of the term 'thing' has also been adopted by Bruno Latour, who, after Heidegger, has worked to transform the semantic emphasis of 'things' from 'matters of fact' to what he describes as 'matters of concern' (2004a). Drawing on older etymologies in which 'thing' denoted a gathering place, a space tor discussion and negotiation, Latour has rehabilitated this sense of the term as a way out of the twin culs-de-sac of constructivism and objectivity His argument that we have never been modern turns on his excavation of a dual separation, whereby modernism is only able to purify (i.e. separate) objects from subjects, non-humans from humans, by denying the proliferation of what he calls 'hybrids' or 'quasi-objects' - things that are simultaneously natural and cultural, subject and object, ideal and material. The point is that one cannot 'purify' - or separate non-human from human - without simultaneously creating more hybrids. These hybrids are constituted in the living fabric of a world that is not just mentally constituted or physically given, but both of those things and more. Their resistance to being teased out into ontologically 'acceptable' categories actually provides the very conditionsof possibility tor the attempts to segregate persons and things which characterise modernism (why would purification be necessary if there was no contamination in the first place?). So Latour has exposed the lie of our modernist leanings, and in so doing has offered a new ontology, which he would claim universally, irrespective of time or place. Our presumed ontological bearings have proved inadequate in his terms, but he has given us new ones to think through.
Where the approach of this volume differs from Latour's work is in the status accorded to the new and more 'democratic' world that emerges from his heuristic usage of 'things'. While our goals may appear comparatively modest in contrast with his re-writing of the Euro-American ontological 'constitution' based on what he has called a 'parliament of things' (2004b), our methodological bent holds out a very different promise. For at the end of the day, Latour offers a new meta-theory whereby the inclusion of non- human/human hybrids portrays everything as a network of entities that breache the object/subject divide. We want to propose a methodology where the 'things' themselves may dictate a plurality of ontologies. Where he presents us with a unifying, revisionist theory of things, we advocate a methodology that might generate a multiplicity of theories. It may be the case that not everything works like a network of hybrids.
So the distinction between 'things-as-analytics' versus 'things-as-heuris- tics' points toward the absolute productivity of non-definition - towards a new impulse within anthropology to move beyond the development of ever more nuanced filters through which to pass phenomena, through to engagements with things as conduits for concept production. Neither definition nor negative definition will suffice. To speak of absolute productivity in this sense is to suggest an openness of method that treating things as meanings dictates, contrasted here with the strategic foreclosures of elevating this principle to the level of a theoretical dictum.
A quiet revolution: from epistemological angst to the ontological
turn
Some of the potential of 'thinking through things' has of course already been realised in the work of a number of authors responsible for what could be seen as something of a quiet revolution in anthropology. This shift has been relatively unselfconscious until recently, performed in the shadows of far more flamboyant theoretical gyrations which took place in the 19808 and 19908 under the banner of 'reflexivity'. Discrete enough to remain nameless, promulgated too loosely across otherwise divergent works to deserve the name of a movement, the tenets of the anthropology we have in mind can nevertheless be gleaned from the works of a number of influential anthropologists, including not only Bruno Latour, but also Alfred Gell, Marilyn Strathem, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro and Roy Wagner. We say 'gleaned' because, despite theimpact that each of these authors is having individually their collective message about a new way of thinking anthropologically is yet to be woven into a positive programme tor future research (though tor an explicit manifesto see Viveiros de Castro 2003, and tor a more enigmatic one see Wagner 2001).Our project draws immediate inspiration from the ways in which this body of work has quietly, almost surreptitiously, radicalised the very aims of anthropological endeavour.
What these authors have in common is that their work points in varying degree toward the analytic advantages of shifting focus from questions of knowledge and epistemology toward those of ontology. What is exciting about such an approach is that, instead of just adapting or elaborating theoretical perspectives - often pillaged from other disciplines 一 to reconfigure the parameters of 'our' knowledge to suit informants' representations of reality, it opens the way for genuinely novel concepts to be produced out of the ethnographic encounter.3 The question then becomes not just how human phenomena may be illuminated (through structuralism!, no, semiotics!, no, phenomenology!, no, Marx showed the way!, etc.) but rather how the phenomena in question may themselves offer illumination. How, in other words, the ways in which people go about their lives may unsettle familiar assumptions, not least those that underlie anthropologists' particular repertories of theory
It is precisely the difference between these two strategic alternatives that is captured by the distinction'between epistemological and ontological orientations in anthropological analysis. Since these terms - 'epistemology' and 'ontology' - are much used and abused in present day discourse, however, it is important to be quite explicit about what work we want them to do for our argument on 'things'. Perhaps the clearest statement of the distinction was given by Eduardo Viveiros de Castro in the last of four lectures delivered to the Department of Social Anthropology at Cambridge in 1998, when contributors to this volume were students (Viveiros de Castro 1998a). In closing the argument of the lectures, which concerned the radical alterity of Amerindian cosmology, Viveiros de Castro offered a diagnosis as to why, despite their professional investment in the task, anthropologists find such cases of alterity difficult to handle:
[A]nthropology seems to believe that its paramount task is to explain how it comes to know (to represent) its object - an object also defined as knowledge (or representation). Is it possible to know it? Is it decent to know it? Do we really know it, or do we only see ourselves in a mirror?
(Viveiros de Castro 1998a: 92)
Anthropologists' epistemological angst, for Viveiros de Castro, is a symptom of a deeper tendency in the history of modernist thought: The Cartesian rupture with medieval scholastics produced a radical simplification of our ontology, by positing only two principles or substances: unextended thought and extended matter. Such simplification is still with us. Modernity started with it: with the massive conversion of ontological into epistemological questions - that is, questions of representation -, a conversion prompted by the fact that every mode of being not assimilable to obdurate 'matter' had to be swallowed by 'thought'. The simplification of ontology accordingly led to an enormous complication of epistemology. After objects or things were pacified, retreating to an exterior, silent and uniform world of 'Nature', subjects began to proliferate and to chatter endlessly: transcendental Egos, legislative Understandings, philosophies of language, theories of mind, social representations, logic of the signifier, webs of signification, discursive practices, politics of knowledge 一 you name it
(Ibid.)
The assumption, then, has always been that anthropology is an episteme - indeed, the episteme of others' epistemes, which we call cultures (cf Wagner 1981; Strathem 1990). The inveteracy of this assumption, argued Viveiros de Castro, is owed to the fact that it is a direct corollary of 'our' ontology - the ontology of modern Euro-Americans, that is. It is because, in our Cartesian- Kantian bind, we assume that the manifold of the universe cannot but consist at most of mind or matter (representation or reality, culture or nature, meaning or thing) that we also cannot but assume that both anthropology and its object are epistemic in character. If we are all living in the same world - one best described and apprehended by science - then the task left to social scientists is to elucidate the various systemic formulations of knowledge (epistemologies) that offer different accounts of that one world. This just follows from the way the dualism of mind and matter apportions questions of difference and similarity Matter is deemed 'indifferent' (our term)4 in the most literal sense: it qualifies as matter just to the extent that it instantiates universal laws. Things of the world may appear different, but the point is that they are different in similar - universal-ways; nature in this sense is 'one'. Culture, on the other hand, is 'many'. After all, while matter (nature) just is what it is indifferently, mind (culture) can represent it in different ways. So, to the extent that anthropology takes difference as its object, leaving the study of the indifferences of nature to natural scientists, it cannot but be a study of the different ways the world (the one world of Nature) is represented by different people - and particularly by different groups of people (Durkheim 1982: 40).
The circularity of this position is part of its remarkable power. Fbr, like a Popperian 'closed system' (Popper 1995), it assimilates all dissent as confirmation 一 as grist to its mill. Were one merely to contemplate the possibilityof a different ontology, one would be forced to capitulate immediately by recognising that such a possibility, by its very virtue of being 'different', cannot but be an alternative representation. Such is the power of the dualist ontology of difference: it exposes all possible adversaries - all putatively alternative ontologies 一 as merely different epistemological positions (artefacts of knowledge). Thus it compasses them within its own terms, much like old-styled Marxists used to do in debate with the bourgeoisie ('your critique of Marx's idea of false consciousness is just an example of it!'). In keeping with its monotheistic origins (Viveiros de Castro 1998a: 91), ours is an ontology of one ontology If 'ontology' simply means the study of the nature of reality, then to speak of multiple ontologies seems an oxymoron at best, or a sign of social pathology and schizophrenia at worst. In any event, the proponents of 'multiple ontologies' can be dismissed as simply promoting a fractured and deliberately incoherent rendering of the 'real world' that (we all know, so the argument goes) is 'out there' - a utopian and polyvocal epistemology emitting from a confused mind which mistakes multiple representations of the world for multiple worlds. What an impasse.
Indeed, the risk of seeking to conceptualise anthropological concerns in ontological terms is precisely that of falling prey to the monomania of 'one ontology'. One of the reasons for which appeals to ontology are often treated with suspicion is surely the ease with which this term can descend into synonymy with 'culture'.5 Rhetorical gestures towards a vague idea that culture has something to do with 'being' are a dualist bugbear. They simply confirm the supposition that differences - as to 'being' or otherwise - are a matter of cultural perspective - perspective, that is, on (definite article) 'the world'.6
^Worldviews9 v. Worlds9
The way out of anthropology's epistemological bind turns on a denial of the key axiom of dualist ontology, namely that difference has to be to similarity what representation is to the world. For if one refuses to attribute difference to culture and similarity to nature, the circular coercion of dualism is rendered limp. In the scheme advanced here, therefore, the presumption of natural unity and cultural difference - epitomised in the anthropos 一 is no longer tenable (cf Argyrou 2002). If we are to take others seriously, instead of reducing their articulations to mere 'cultural perspectives' or 'beliefs' (i.e. 'worldviews'), we can conceive them as enunciations of different 'worlds' or 'natures', without having to concede that this is just shorthand for 'worldviews'.
Now, this shift in orientation may have an air of scholastic preciousness about it. Aren't the two options, of rendering difference as a property of representation or of the world, just symmetrical? And isn't the choice between epistemology and ontology merely a matter of vocabulary - a matter of whether one prefers to speak of 'worldviews' or 'worlds'? Ultimately,do these differences about difference really make any difference? They do, because the apparent symmetry is only grammatical. This becomes clear as soon as one adds a third pair of terms to the equations in question, the traditional corollary of representation versus world, namely the contrast between appearance and reality. In its traditional rendition (representation - appearance, world - reality), it is just this extra implication that makes the power of dualism so pernicious to anthropological thinking. For if cultures render different appearances of reality, it follows that one of them is special and better than all the others, namely the one that best reflects reality. And since science 一 the search tor representations that reflect reality as transparently and faithfully as possible - happens to be a modem Western project, that special culture is, well, ours (cf Latour 2002).
This implication, of course, lies at the heart of the resilient positivist agenda of a 'social science". Differences between people's representations can be explained (or even, more evangelically, settled) by appeal to our most privileged representations, whose chief difference from others is that they are true - true, that is, 'to the world'. But a very similar notion underlies the habitual anthropological retort to positivism, namely cultural relativism (cf Sperber 1985: 38顼1;cf. Latour 1993: 103-14). True, relativists will deny that certain representations have a superior claim to reality. If the world can only be apprehended through representations, they will argue, then 'reality' or 'truth' are just properties with which we, representational!^ invest it. Nature is a mirror, goes the argument, and our sense of its reality is constructed in our own image, just like others construct it in theirs.
Nevertheless, relativists are paradoxically just as inclined as positivists to accord special status to their own representations. Having barred themselves from appealing to 'truth', they appeal instead to what philosophers of social science called 'adequacy' (e.g. Taylor 1971:4-5). According to this view, since all we have is alternative worldviews, the fantasy of explanation must be replaced by the necessity of interpretation - rendering others' representations in the idiom of our own. While such an image of anthropological work is clearly more pluralistic than positivism (inasmuch as interpretation is a game everyone can play 一 even scientists), upon close inspection it turns out to be no less universalistic. This is because, as positivists like to tease (e.g. Sperber 1985: 41-9), tor the notion of interpretation to get off the ground at all (i.e. tor it to avoid the logical pitfail of the cultural agnosticism we call 'ethnocentrism'), relativists must assume that their representations, though partial, are nevertheless adequate in principle to the task of translating the nuances of others'. How, logically speaking, can relativists assert without contradiction that our representations are both partial with respect to others' and rich enough to translate them? The answer, anathema to them no doubt, is logically unavoidable. Cross-cultural translation must be mediated by some point of comparison - an element that can be posited, if not as supra- cultural, then at least as a point of cultural convergence. Enter 'the world',as itchy as a phantom limb following metaphysical amputation. 'They see things differently than we do', relativists say, thereby carting the 'things' of 'the world' back into the picture, against their own better judgement, to guarantee the possibility of adequate cross-cultural translations. It is just for this reason that that perfect Cartesian capsule of a word 一 <world-view, 一 does not strike our otherwise avid anti-Cartesians as oxymoronic. And it is for this reason also that they can be as presumptuous about the merits of their own analytics 一 their interpretative 'tools' - as positivists are about their 'truths'. Though each of us may talk partially, we all talk about the world, and therefore we can talk about others' versions too.
An ontological turn in anthropological analysis refutes these presumptions wholesale. The mysterious-sounding notion of 'many worlds' is so dissimilar to the familiar idea of a plurality of worldviews precisely because it turns on the humble - though on this view logically obvious 一 admission that our concepts (not our 'representations') must, by definition, be inadequate to translate different ones. This, it is suggested, is the only way to take difference - alterity - seriously as the starting point for anthropological analysis. One must accept that when someone tells us, say, that powder is power, the anthropological problem cannot be that of accounting for why he might think that about powder (explaining, interpreting, placing his statement into context), but rather that if that really is the case, then we just do not know what powder he is talking about. This is an ontological problem through and through. For its answer is patently not to be found by searching 'in the world' - maybe in Cuba? - for some special powerful powder. The world in which powder is power is not an uncharted (and preposterous!) region of our own (ci. Viveiros de Castro 2005; Ardener 1989). It is a different world, in which what we take to be powder is actually power, or, more to the point, a third element which will remain ineffably paradoxical for as long as we insist on glossing it with our own default concepts 一 neither 'powder' nor 'power' but, somehow, both, or better still, the same thing.
Two steps to ontological breakthrough
So since these 'different worlds' are not to be found in some forgotten comer of our own, then where are they? The answer to this question, which goes to the heart of the method of 'thinking through things', involves two parts - two steps to ontological breakthrough, as it were. In order to understand the first step, consider what the epistemologically informed reaction to the question would look like. Since different worlds are not parts of the world, then they must somehow be a function of our representations - what else? Now, obviously such a reply is no more than a throwback to epistemological orthodoxy (one world, many worldviews). But what it serves to illustrate in its seeming inevitability, is that the logical consequences of the notion of 'different worlds' go deeper than just inverting the familiar formula of 'difference is tosimilarity what representation is to the world5. For as long as our ordinary intuitions as to what 'the world5 is remain untutored, the notion of 'different worlds' will remain contradictory (surely such worlds can only be imagined - i.e. represented - because part of the very definition of the world is that it is single). Thus, for the notion of 'different worlds' to make any sense at all it must be understood without recourse to its putative opposite, that is, different representations. Indeed, the difficulty of this notion - as well as its logical coherence -lies precisely in the fact that it denies the opposition of representation v. world altogether, rather than merely inverting its implications.7
It is for this reason, for example, that the claim that when Cuban diviners say that powder is power they are speaking of a different powder (and a different power also) is not a 'constructivist5 claim (cf Latour 1999: 21-3). To put it in Foucauldian terms, the point is not that discursive claims (e.g. 'powder is power5) order reality in different ways - according to different 'regimes of truth5 - but rather that they create new objects (e.g. powerful powder) in the very act of enunciating new concepts (e.g. powerful powder). Though Foucault would say that discourse creates its objects, he still works from the presumption that there is some real-world fodder out there. For example, while a body may not be male or female until a discourse of gender invokes this as an operative distinction, there is still a body to which the discourse refers.8 By contrast, what is advanced here is, if you like, an entirely different kind of constructivism - a radical constructivism not dissimilar to that envisaged by Deleuze (Deleuze and Guattari 1994: 7, 35- 6).9 Discourse can have effects not because it 'over-determines reality5, but because no ontological distinction between 'discourse5 and 'reality5 pertains in the first place. In other words, concepts can bring about things because concepts and things just are one and the same (one and the same 'thing5, we could say 一 using the term heuristically).
So, in summary, the syllogism is this. We start with the ordinary (repre- sentationist/epistemological) assumption that concepts are the site of difference. Then we argue that in order for difference to be taken seriously (as 'alterity5), the assumption that concepts are ontologically distinct from the things to which they are ordinarily said to 'refer5 must be discarded. From this it follows that alterity can quite properly be thought of as a property of things - things, that is, which are concepts as much as they appear to us as 'material5 or 'physical5 entities. Hence the first answer to the incredulous question of where 'different worlds' might be, is here, in front of us, in the things themselves (things like powder or 一 as we'll see in the contributions to this book - photographs, legal documents, shamanic costumes, cigarettes, and so on). So this is a method of 'back to the things themselves5, as the phenomenologists had it, but only with the caveat that this is not because the 'life-world5 of our 'experience5 of things has priority over a 'theoretical attitude5 (Husserl1970), but precisely because our experience of things, if you will, can be conceptual (see also Holbraad, this volume). But this innnediately provokes another - and surely equally incredulous 一 question, which precipitates the second step towards locating these seemingly elusive 'different worlds'. If things really are different, as we argue, then why do they seem the same? If 'different worlds' reside in things, so to speak, then how could we have missed them tor so long? Why, when we look at Cuban diviners' powders, do we see just that - powder? And what would we have to do to see it as 'powerful powder'? - whatever that might be ... Still, if incredulity finds its credentials in 'common sense', it should be obvious that these questions make no sense tor precisely that reason. True, common sense would insist on casting the question of 'different worlds' in terms of the ways in which they may or may not 'appear' to a knowing - or 'seeing' - subject. Such a visualist key, however, may not always be appropriate, depending on how far one takes 'seeing' as a metaphor (cf Empson and Pedersen, this volume). The very notion of perception simply reiterates the distinction that 'different worlds' collapses. The point about different worlds is that they cannot be 'seen' in a visualist sense. They are, as it were, a-visible. In other words, collapsing the distinction between concepts and things (appearance and reality) forces us to conceive of a different mode of disclosure altogether. The question then arises of how the things encountered in the course of ethnographic work become apparent.
This is where the first term in the title of our project, namely thinking, is important. If, as we argue, the notion of 'different worlds' stands or falls by the identification of things with concepts, then it follows that on such an image things disclose themselves not as perceptions but as conceptions. Consider the Cuban diviners once more. Their assertion that 'powder is power', we have argued, is not to be taken as some kind of bizarre empirical claim - an 'apparently irrational belief' about powder, demanding anthropological 'explanation' or 'interpretation' (cf Sperber 1985). This is not a statement about what we know as powder at all. It is the enunciation of a concept of powder with which we are quite unfamiliar; or, better put, it is the enunciation of an unfamiliar 'powder-concept', where the hyphen serves to emphasise that the possibility for such an enunciation depends on collapsing the distinction between the concept of powder and powder 'itself'.
But if in saying that powder is power Cuban diviners are expressing a powder-concept that is new to us, then how can we possibly hope to understand it? How can we conceive of a world in which powder is power, without falling prey to the accusation of social pathology or schizophrenia mentioned earlier? How do we maintain our footing on ontological rather than epistemological ground? And if such an act of conception is emphatically not a matter of merely imagining - i.e. representing - a world in which powder is power as a possibility (for this would be just to imagine powder differently, whereas what is at stake here is a different powder), then what does it involve? The answer is embedded in the questions. To conceive of a different powder (a 'different world') is to conceive it 一 to think it into being,because thought here just is being. Conception is a mode of disclosure (of - metaphorical-'vision') that creates its own objects, just because it is one and the same with them, so to 'see' these objects is to create them. Think of it. Ybu, the reader, 'see' the point we are striving to 'make' here by making it tor yourself, perhaps lifting your eyes from the text occasionally, to 'think the point through' (much as we have had to do while writing it). So too anthropologists may 'see different worlds''by creating them. Creating thingconcepts like 'powerful powder', not so much in our mind's eye, as in our eye's mind.
So, if the first step to 'ontological breakthrough' is to realise that 'different worlds' are to be found in 'things', the second one is to accept that seeing them requires acts of conceptual creation - acts which cannot of course be reduced to mental operations (to do so would be merely to revert to the dualism of mental representation versus material reality). On this view, anthropological analysis has little to do with trying to determine how other people think about the world. It has to do with how we must think in order to conceive a world the way they do. In this sense the method of 'thinking through things', geared towards creating new analytical concepts, is a recursive one. As each of the contributions to this volume illustrates, it is because our informants (e.g. diviners, lawyers, prisoners, shamans, nomads, etc.) think through things (e.g. powder, legal texts, cigarettes, costumes, photographs) that we might think of doing the same.
This point about recursivity will be taken up later, in examining the debt this method owes to Roy Wagner's holographic notion of 'invention'. But it should be noted here that there is an important asymmetry between informants' conceptual creations and the second-order creativity advocated tor anthropological purposes. This has to do with the way the 'game' of anthropology, as Viveiros de Castro has called it, is set up (2002). For while the outcome of our analytical acts of conception is, in the proposed method, required to be the same as our informants' (e.g. to conceive a powder that is power), their point of departure is by definition quite distinct. We may or may not know what assumptions precipitate our informants' conceptual creativity (e.g. what concepts of powder and power they seek to elaborate upon when they are motivated to 'make the point' that the two are the same). This is a matter of ethnographic remit. But even if we do know, we cannot take it for granted that these 'obviated' concepts 一 to use Wagner's terminology (e.g. 1981:44;1986: 50-1)-do not enunciate worlds that are just as perplexingly 'different' as the ones upon which our informants proceed to elaborate. So whatever end of this infinitely regressive stick we try to grasp will not be so much wrong, as a-visible in principle. On the other hand, what we can grasp is our own assumptions. We have concepts of powder and power, and we 'know' that they are not the same, contrary to Cuban diviners' (apparent) claims. This, we would argue, is an enabling (perhaps the only enabling) starting point for conceptual creation. How farand in what direction must we change our own concepts before we too can assent to our informants' initially bizarre claims? How far do we need to change our assumptions about what counts as 'powder' and 'power' before we too can say consistently that they are one and the same?
It should further be noted that 'our' ability to conceive both powder and powder-power does not suddenly give us the ontological upper hand over our informants. It is not that the old assumption of an anthropological 'episterne of all epistemes' has merely been replaced by an ontology of all ontologies. Rather, handicapped by a dualist ontology (and the scientific rationalism to which it gives rise) anthropologists need a method to recuperate a facility their informants may already have. We need to seize on a methodology that allows for concept production that makes worlds. And this is a 'humbling' method, inasmuch as it depends on our admission that our own concepts are inadequate, and therefore need to be transformed by appeal to those of our informants.
As will be shown in the next section, contributors to this volume explore the potential of this kind of concept creation in a variety of ways, not least because the things they think through are so variedly 'different'. For the sake of clarity, however, it may be useful to illustrate the preceding discussion about the ontological turn in anthropology by returning to what is perhaps the most seminal anthropological attempt to think through a thing, namely Marcel Mauss' famous account of the relationship between persons and things in Maori 'gifts' (Mauss 1990). Mauss' argument can be interpreted in a way that illustrates the rudiments of the ontological remit of 'thinking through things'. However, some of his most influential followers have cast his argument about persons and things in 'epistemological' terms (as defined above), exemplifying the ease with which ontological questions can retreat back to the safer ground of epistemology.
Precedents in Maussian anthropology
Mauss' seminal contribution, in terms of the issues explored here, was to take seriously the 'primitive' identification of aspects of personhood with the things that he collectively described as 'gifts'. Instead of dismissing ancestor-artefacts and objects imbued with the personality of former owners as evidence of primitive animism or superstition, he embraced these unfamiliar entities, marshalling them in a critique of assumptions that prevailed within his own society Henare's chapter in this volume revisits the classic passage on which Mauss based his discussion of Maori gift exchange, from a letter written by the Maori elder Tamati Ranapiri to ethnologist Elsdon Best. As every anthropology student must learn, Ranapiri's identification of taonga (valued articles) with hau (the 'spirit of the gift') led Mauss to develop his theory of social obligation that impels reciprocity.10 Just as we propose using 'things' that arise in the course of ethnography as heuristicdevices, then, so Mauss engaged with Maori taonga, among other things, to explore their theoretical potential.
Yet there are two significantly different ways of understanding Mauss5 argument about the alterity of 'gifts' and the ways in which they collapse persons and things into one another, each of which has been played out in the anthropological literature. The first, which we would characterise as epistemological, starts by treating the categories of 'person5 and 'thing5 as analytically separate, then seeks to explain why these seemingly separate entities are - tor Maori - the same. Chris Gregory's Marxist gloss of gifts as 'inalienable objects'(1982) is a particularly influential example of this approach. Along with other criteria, the question of alienability is supposed to show the difference between 'objects', when viewed as gifts (inalienable) or as commodities (alienable). The difference is made, in the former case, by adding persons to things and, in the latter, by keeping them separate. Thus the gift registers as an analytic oxymoron: a thing that is unlike things, tor it is inalienable from persons. The aggregative logic of this mode of analysis (thing + person) can be characterised as epistemological because the job of anthropological analysis in this scheme is to determine how a set of analytical concepts (e.g. 'things' and 'persons') may relate to different ethnographic settings (gift economies involve things + persons, commodity economies involve things). The anthropologist, in other words, determines how (analytical) concepts apply to their informants' representations, an essentially interpretive exercise.
A similar argument might be advanced with respect to Alfred Gell's influential attempt in Art and Agency to elaborate what he, like Gregory, explicitly calls a Maussian theory of artefacts (1998: 9; cf Pinney and Thomas 2001).Proposing to 'consider art objects as persons' (ibid), Gell sets out a sophisticated conceptual framework with which to show how objects come to possess social agency, much like people. Perhaps the most inspiring aspect of his argument is the attempt to conceive a form of agency that emerges as 'a global characteristic of the world of people and things in which we live, rather than as an attribute of the human psyche, exclusively' (ibid.'. 20). Yet ultimately, as Leach argues in this volume, Gell casts objects as 'only secondary agents' whose capacity to act is rendered metaphorical by its dependence on the context of social relationships (ibid.:17). Insofar as their agency originates in the minds of their creators (at least as much as in 'the material world'), his art objects stop short of revising our commonsense notions of 'person' or 'thing'. For agency, here, remains irreducibly human in origin, and its investment into things necessarily derivative; things gain social agency insofar as they are embedded in social relationships between persons. Though Gell's avowed intention is 'to take seriously notions about agency which even [. . .] philosophers would probably not want to defend' (ibid.: 17), in retaining the analytical distinction between 'person' and 'thing' he stays closer to received philosophical wisdom. Whilst his work hints atthe possibility of a plurality of worlds, rather than simply worldviews, his appeal to Mauss, like that of Gregory seems to entail only an unfamiliar aggregation of familiar concepts.
Now, the alternative approach, described here as ontological, regards the identification of 'person' and 'thing' in Mauss' 'gift' as an act of concept production rather than one of mere aggregation. Gell's work could also be read this way, as Pedersen's contribution to this volume maintains. In this scheme, 'person' and 'thing' are no more than heuristic tags used to account for something else, namely what Gell invokes with the term 'agent', and what Ranapiri was trying to convey when he said that the taonga 'is' the hau of the gift. The reason why Ranapiri's statement is difficult to understand, and why it has led to a century's worth of anthropological debate, is not that it necessarily challenges familiar assumptions about 'persons' and 'things' - requiring scholars to expand their concepts to accommodate, for example, animate pieces of wood - but because it offers an alternative definition altogether of what elements constitute gift relations - hau and taonga, rather than persons and things. In this reading, Ranapiri was not assuming that Best shared his understanding of what persons and things are, only to proceed to explain how in certain contexts a thing (a special Maori one, called a taonga) may count as a person. Instead he was showing that, when it comes to gifts of taonga, these concepts are altogether insufficient. For what is at stake here for the anthropologist is a third concept: one that results when our notions of 'thing' and 'person' are mutually transformed through an encounter with Ranapiri's assertion that 'the taonga is the hau". This illustrates the difference between epistemology and ontology as we understand it. While the former seeks to find ways to apply concepts that are already known to unfamiliar instances, the latter treats the unfamiliarity of those instances as an occasion to transform concepts, so as to give rise to new ones. It is not that 'persons' and 'things' have different referents for Maori - an epistemological question. It is that 'persons' and 'things' are different from that which animates Maori gift exchange - an ontological claim.
While it is beyond the scope of this introduction to offer a comprehensive review of the literature in which the shift from epistemological to ontological orientations has so far been manifest, it may help to draw out aspects of the work we consider has precipitated this move. Despite the fact that Marilyn Strathem has not couched her own efforts in terms of an ontologising anthropology, we believe that such a perspective can be read back into much of her material. Indeed, while the Maussian character of Strathem's analysis of Melanesian gift-giving is well established (e.g. Graeber 2001: 37), perhaps the principal affinity of her strategy to Mauss's lies in her willingness to use Melanesian gifts as an occasion to transform analytical assumptions. In other words, if Strathem is Maussian, she is so in the ontological sense outlined above. When asking questions about the nature of 'persons' in Highland Papua New Guinea, Strathem rejects an approach that would seek merely to broaden the Anglophone concepts of 'person' and 'thing' to accommodate Melanesian data. Rather, faced with a situation in which gifts contain the gendered relations which they instantiate, she is willing to pursue the conceptual effect that such an occasion implies - to tackle the theoretical implications of the gift-as-heuristic, in other words. It is not that Melanesian gifts are also 'persons' in terms familiar to the anthropologist 一 they are not 'individuals' in terms of the 'possessive individualism' that animates Euro-American conceptualisations of what constitutes a 'person'. Rather, Strathem treats the insufficiency of 'persons' and 'things' as concepts through which to apprehend Melanesian gift-giving as an opportunity to transform those very concepts. Where a gift instantiates a social relation rather than merely being a symbolic representation of that relation, it follows that Melanesian 'persons' can no longer be conceived as existing prior to relationships in which they subsequently become implicated through exchange. Instead, Melanesian persons have to be construed as relations per se (hence Strathem's famous evocation of the 'dividual' as a 'distributed person'(1988: 13,15;1991: 53). This forces us to re-think our concept of the person, and particularly its relevance to social situations less familiar than our own. Against possessive individualism, which turns on the assumption that people are discrete entities that can enter into relations, Strathem has effectively created a new concept of the 'person' that follows Melanesians themselves in locating personhood in the relations that exchange entails.11
However, the differences between Strathem and Mauss are as significant as the similarities. While Mauss is incited by the seeming inadequacy of 'person' and 'thing' with respect to hau to subvert those categories, he stops short of formulating alternative categories. Consider the excerpt from The Gift below:
However, we can go even farther than we have gone up to now. One can dissolve, jumble up together, colour and define differently the principal notions that we have used. The terms that we have used - present and gift - are not themselves entirely exact. We shall, however, find no others. These concepts of law and economics that it pleases us to contrast: liberty and obligation; liberality, generosity, and luxury, as against savings, interest, and utility - it would be good to put them in the melting pot once more. We can only give the merest indications on this subject. Let us choose, for example, the Trobriand Islands. There they still have a complex notion that inspires all the economic acts we have described. Yet this notion is neither that of the free, purely gratuitous rendering of total services, nor that of production and exchange purely interested in what is useful. It is a sort of hybrid that flourished.
(Mauss 1990: 72-3, references omitted) Effectively, Mauss here posits the 'hybridity' of the Trobriand concept, as the endpoint of his analysis. This made sense in terms of his political project, which sought to utilise the analytical subversion of the concepts of 'person' and 'thing' to perform a political subversion. The present programme takes its cue more from Strathem's endeavours to move beyond the negative gesture of hybridity - where a third concept emerges that is still somehow predicated on the familiar concepts fused in the putative hybrid - toward the positive analytical end of genuine concept creation. It is not that the hybrid is not new. It is simply that it is not new enough insofar as it still refers recursively back to those concepts it seeks to replace. Where Mauss throw up his hands and cannot see beyond giving the 'merest indications' that a third concept is at stake - one that is more unique than a mere colouring of our given concepts would imply 一 Strathem's use of the concept of the 'dividual'12 can be seen as taking up exactly that challenge.
In fact the contrast between Mauss' strategy and that developed here can perhaps be taken even further. While Mauss recognises that the concepts at his disposal are too 'thick' or freighted to enable his ontological revision, he settles for a 'colouring' or 'combining' (the melting pot metaphor) in order to keep working through them. This, we would suggest, signals a use of concepts as analytics rather than heuristics. Strathem, on the other hand, might be said to use the concept of 'person' heuristically in just the sense we have sought to outline. Her use is heuristic in that it under-determines what a 'person' might be, such that it allows (in her case) for attention to be focused on 'relations' rather than entities. So, arguably it is only because her initial conception of the 'person' is so peculiarly empty that her analysis is able to arrive at the concept of the 'dividual', as much more than simply a re-colouring of the Western concept of the 'individual.'
Strathem's strategy with regard to Melanesian gifts thus exemplifies the approach proposed here. The difference, of course, is that whereas in this part of her work, it is 'persons' that Strathem treats as the enabling heuristic (cf Strathem 1988: 18), the contributors to this volume chart a similar course with respect to 'things'. We propose to think through things because our informants do. While persons may be just as salient a category for reflection, we suggest that the application of this analytical strategy to 'things' yields new and different kinds of insights. What draws together all of the contributions to this volume is a shared concern for things - not solely on the part of the ethnographer/analyst, 'but by the informants themselves in these varied contexts.
This loop - the recursive relationship between informants' concerns and the methodological stances of ethnographers - owes much to Roy Wagner's concept of cultural 'invention'. For one of the major strands of Wagner's Invention of Culture (1981)is a systematic account of the roles anthropologists play in 'inventing' the cultures they purport to study (see also Wagner 2001).13 The twist 一 so central to the argument made here 一 is that Wagner'snotion of invention is neither counterposed to 'reality' nor construed as an exclusive property of human genius.14 Rather, it is presented as the mode by which reality (or 'worlds', as we would say) is constituted - an ontological exercise par excellence. For Wagner, invention is just the process by which concepts are transformed in the very act of being 'applied' in new contexts, so that, strictly speaking, concepts come to carry their contexts within themselves (Wagner 1986; cf. Strathem 1990: 33).15 So, like Strathem after him, Wagner sees the encounter between anthropologists' own concepts and those of their informants as a productive one because of their divergences. As the two are brought into contact, their sense is transformed through what Wagner calls 'metaphorical extension'(1981:38-9).
But what is pertinent about Wagner's strategy here is not only the analytic purchase of this theory of metaphor, but also the recursive tactic by which he arrives at it. The very novelty of his proposition to Euro-American ears is perhaps owed to its peculiarly Papua New Guinean provenance. As he remarks, the meta-anthropological proposal of The Invention of Culture originates from his earlier ethnography of invention as the central modality of Melanesian social life, as explored in Habu, his treatise on the role of 'the innovation of meaning in Daribi religion', as the book's subtitle puts it (Wagner 1972; cf 1981:xiv-xvi). Such a recursive relationship,'between what informants do and the techniques anthropologists bring to bear in their study of them, is also central to the strategy of this collection. In this light, the meta-anthropological argument about the value of 'thinking through things' is merely a holographic capitulation - to use the Melanesianist idiom - to the collective impact of the ethnographic studies collected in this volume.
While our contributors may not necessarily subscribe without qualification to the more didactic aspects of the editors' argument about 'thinking through things' as a method, the ways in which people think through things is the ethnographic theme that brought these essays together in the first place. Writing from widely varying ethnographic settings, the contributors are all motivated by their informants' evident concern with 'things' and their conceptual effects. So, for example, a central claim in Reed's account of smoking in a Port Moresby prison is that inmates' preoccupation with cigarettes, far from being an extra-curricular activity bom of boredom or despair, stems rather from the fact that smoking is constitutive of the very concept of prison sociality (much as for Holbraad powder is constitutive of Cuban diviners' notion of power). Similarly, the two Mongolianist contributions (by Empson and Pedersen) show how ceremonial objects 一 altars and shamanic costumes respectively - act as conduits through which their informants are able to 'see, 一 conceptually create, that is - salient aspects of Mongolian kinship and religion. Wastell and Henare both turn their interest to the law - often seen as the discursive, abstract form par excellence. Wastell's focus is on the way in which Swazis engage with the received law as a civic totem - a reified thing - which presences a non-Swazi form of powerand efficacy Henare, meanwhile, addresses the role of Maori taonga (treasured items including things from traditional lore to scientific knowledge) in a much-debated legal claim in New Zealand. Finally Leach, looking at creative collaborations between artists and scientists in Britain, shows what happens when informants5 attempts to think through things falter. While the 'sci-art collaborations5 he studies were set up with the explicit aim of producing new forms of creativity through artists5 and scientists5 joint production of artefacts, collaborators5 preoccupations with personal authorship foreclosed the more experimental aspirations of this project.
So 'thinking through things' is recursive as an anthropological method, in that it draws mileage (the potential for producing novel analytical concepts) from informants' own ontological projects. Indeed, the idea of 'native ontology5, as it were, is problematised most explicitly by Moutu, who in his contribution sets out to show that the activity of collecting can be seen as 'a way of being5, as he puts it, that has 'ontological effects5. Bringing together an eclectic variety of 'ethnographic vignettes5 - his own 'collection5, as he points out - Moutu seeks to dispel the assumption that collections are merely a practical implementation of a collector's pre-established classificatory scheme - a view he brands as 'epistemological5, in a manner confluent with the argument laid out above. Drawing on his own fieldwork among the latmul of Papua New Guinea, as well as that conducted by Gregory Bateson, Moutu argues that in juxtaposing (rather than merely classifying) objects, the activity of collecting has an ontological effect in that it alters the objects it gathers together, reconstituting them by placing them in a set of relations that are internal and peculiar to the collection itself
One of Moutu's most evocative vignettes concerns an exhibition that residents of small villages located along the north coast of Papua New Guinea helped to produce following a devastating tsunami attack in 1998. Whereas one might approach such an exhibition as an illustration or narration of the story of the tsunami and its aftermath, Moutu argues that the assembling of artefacts, film footage, photographs and even the survivors at the exhibition's opening, helped to produce a story that could not have been anticipated prior to the gathering. That is to say, what was at stake in the exhibition was not the faithful representation of the event of the tsunami, but rather the expectation that by bringing artefacts related to this event together, the tsunami could be understood in wholly new terms vis-a-vis the relations created in the juxtaposition of the various artefacts. Moutu analyses this in terms of a Papua New Guinean proclivity to look for the 'root causes5 of such tragedies - 'human and spiritual agencies [. . .] [that] are considered integral to the explanations of devastating misfortunes5. Moving backwards in time, to excavate artefacts from the loss caused by the catastrophe, the tsunami survivors brought these objects back into the present. This very act, argues Moutu, had an ontological effect inasmuch as the juxtapositions of objects in the exhibition re-constituted the event in a unique way From themove backwards into loss, there followed an acceleration forward in time, which ultimately allowed the tsunami survivors to re-constitute themselves through a revelation of what the tsunami was (in terms of its root causes). The tsunami was not remembered, it was conceived.
When people think through things
The point of this collection of essays is that 'native ontology5 must always be cast in the plural. The conceptual effects of collecting may be presumed to be different from those of divining, legal claim making, and so forth. And this is precisely why thinking through things can only be understood as a methodological project as opposed to a theory in its own right, because these disparate activities may well generate equally disparate ontologies. No one theory can encompass this diversity because to theorise is of a type with these tasks and so in turn can only generate its ontology - in the singular. It follows that the promise of thinking through things cannot be to offer another consummate theory, but rather a method for generating a plurality of concepts or theories. The contributions to this volume are intended as examples of the ways in which these possibilities may be implemented anthropologically, and the plethora of new concepts which may emerge from such an approach.
Reed's discussion of cigarettes in Bomana gaol, Papua New Guinea, foregrounds the agency of tobacco or smuk in everyday prison life. Taking seriously prisoners5 claims that cigarettes 'kill memory5 and 'shorten time5, Reed describes a world in which 'smuk is king5, not simply in the metaphorical sense (as an item people will go to great lengths to acquire) but because, for the inmates of Bomana gaol, smuk 'is the dominant actor in prison5. More than something to do while passing time, tobacco smoking is held to alter one's state of mind in ways which Reed finds are not reducible to its chemical effects. In allowing prisoners to forget their debts and obligations outside prison, smuk at once creates the possibility for new relations, and provides the substance of those alliances and friendships, instantiated in the sharing of cigarettes. The shifting constellation of prison sociality is thus 'shaped by the way these objects flow5, and Reed draws a parallel here between the workings of smuk in Bomana and the ways in which money has been analysed by economic anthropologists as central to social reproduction. Like other forms of currency, smuk^s generative potential derives not simply from its abstract value in a system of exchange but also from its distinctive properties as a 'thing5. As with Holbraad's ache powder, its part- ibility is crucial to the kinds of effects it is able to produce, just as the scale of the units into which it is broken for distribution (packets, cigarettes) is dictated by the peculiar way in which it must be consumed. As the sine qua non of prison life, smuk itself provides the constitutive logic of social relations inside gaol; it is the substance in which they are manifest and the thingthrough which they are thought. Smuk is thus an irreducible component not only of sociality but of knowledge, and Reed5s chapter, like Pedersen5s (see below), deploys the dissonance between familiar assumptions and things encountered in the field to reassess representationist theories of knowledge.
Now if smuk proves a generative concept for Reed, Henare5s exploration of Maori invocations of taonga offers a similar example. Thinking through 'Wai 262', a claim to New Zealand's Waitangi Tribunal, the body appointed by government to investigate breaches of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, she argues that the claim may be regarded as a concerted attempt on the part of the claimants to transform received conceptions of property. This is achieved by forcing the law to recognise (and incorporate into itself) the notion that the 'persons' and 'things' it habitually separates may be considered one and the same, as they are in the concept of taonga. In doing so, Maori bring taonga and commodities 'into a single generative sphere' rather than simply fusing two seemingly incommensurable concepts. Just as Western property law continually expands to accommodate ever more things into the constellation of what can be owned, so too do Maori registers of value exhibit a similar facility in the text of the Wai 262 claim. However, whereas Western law appears to expand its purview through the production of hybrid concepts (e.g. one can own an idea because an idea, although immaterial, is like a thing because both are products of human labour), taonga operates by generating a new conceptual dimension within the realm of property law. In exploring this intervention, Henare plays close attention to the text of the claim, proposing that the claim itself may be understood in Maori terms as a certain kind of taonga 一 an instantiation of ancestral effect. Passages in the text, written predominantly in English, are left untranslated from Maori, thereby 'asserting the mana or authority of Maori concepts and terminology'. Taonga are thus deployed heuristically in two ways: first by Maori people in their claim-making, and second by Henare herself, as a device to transform the available terms of analysis into something more appropriate to the situation at hand. Just as Moutu argues that collecting 'brings things into a new set of relations rather than merely illustrating a pre-existent classificatory scheme, the claimant's invocation of taonga refuses a pre-figured opposition between taonga and commodities, instead generating a uniquely Maori modality in which 'property rights are subsumed in taonga relations'.
Now, if Maori are engaging with law in such a way that two apparently incommensurable registers of value are encompassed in the invocation of taonga, the Swazis in Wastell's account appear to be doing quite the reverse. In her discussion of Swazi engagements with the received ('Western') law, Wastell argues that Swazis use the law to create separations and social diversity In a world where all are one in the body and person of a divine king, it is difference and social pluralism which must be produced. Offering an analogy to the ways in which Swazi praise-names (tinanentelo) producestratified clan hierarchies which allows tor claims to be made, Wastell demonstrates how the Swazi reification of a 'legal thing5 generates a similar sort of social distance and differentiation. Following Dumont's arguments on hierarchy (1970) she suggests that the received law serves two distinct functions tor Swazis. On one level, it cuts across the (normally undifferentiated) social body that is 'the Swazi5, in much the same way as praise-names do. At another level, received law instantiates the totemic authority of a non-Swazi 'other5, presenting a magical authority which is of a type with, but ultimately also in contest with, the kingship. Thus, received law instantiates two disparate formulations of social diversity at once.
The concept production at work here derives from the fact that social diversity in this instance does not map onto a more familiar 'Western5 notion of social pluralism as a description of a existing state of affairs. Rather, social pluralism emerges as a product of legal claims, courtroom activities and Swazis5 fascination for legal paraphernalia - again echoing Moutu5s argument about the ontological effects of collections. Just as collecting is not merely an 'acting out5 of an already existing typology, Swazi engagements with law - far from levelling social diversity through an appeal to legal equality, as the rule of law would have it - manufacture peculiarly Swazi concepts of inequality and difference.
The key concept at work in Empson5s contribution is xishig, a Mongolian term she translates as 'fortune5 (not dissimilar to Holbraad5s discussion of Cuban ache as power). Mongols consistently work to maintain good fortune by keeping back parts of people, animals and things from which they have been separated (for example through migration, marriage or sale). In xishig, Empson notes, 'something has to be given away in order for it to be kept back to support and increase the whole5, a principle she also finds evident in Mongolian kinship, which 'relies on the separation and transformation of people in order for sameness, or consanguinity, to continue5. In thinking through the items kept inside and displayed on top of household chests, (arrangements which model familial networks of kin and association) Empson deploys the encounter between xishig and more familiar notions of fortune and relatedness to arrive at new insights into ways of reckoning Mongolian kinship.
In particular, Empson's argument turns on a second conceptual transformation, this time regarding the workings of vision and visibility (or invisibility) in the ways in which Buryat-Mongol relations are conceived. While certain (mainly agnatic and inherited) connexions are made continually visible in the photographic montages displayed on top of chests (which replaced the genealogical charts banned under socialism) other kinds of relationships are kept hidden from view inside the chest, namely those that are 'the products of the separation and movement of people between groups'. Their (a-visible) presence inside the chest instantiates the conditions of flux and movement against which the stability of the agnatic ties prominentlyvisible on the chesfs surface must be maintained, and thus throws this relative stability (expressed in photomontage form) sharply into relief Empson analyses these two components of the chest, the visible and the invisible, as interdependent kinship perspectives that produce different kinds of relations. It is only in viewing the family chest, she argues, with all its visible and invisible components, that it is possible to see simultaneously the different perspectives through which kinship is reckoned. The chest thus becomes, in Empson's analysis, an essential component of Mongolian relationality It is the only site in which it is possible to piece together, through the mechanism of reciprocal vision, a total sense of self In this analysis our concept of vision is transformed. Far from being a mere physiological reaction to external stimuli, vision becomes,the tool by which relations are created5.
Pedersen's analysis of Darhad shamanic regalia similarly draws attention to how certain kinds of artefacts enable Mongolian social relations to be reckoned - and brought into being - in ways that would not be possible in their absence. In an article weaving insights from cognitive science together with those of Melanesian and Amazonian ethnography, he describes how shamanic robes and spirit vessels serve as essential 'socio-cognitive scaffolding5 that allow Darhad Mongols - and shamans in particular 一 to 'see' themselves and their relationships from perspectives that would otherwise be literally inconceivable. Following Gell and Susanne Kuchler's analysis of the malanggan sculptures of New Ireland, the objects of Pedersen's analysis are more than representations of specific kinds of social knowledge produced elsewhere; they are the vehicles whose very form and substance make that knowledge possible. Vet, like Viveiros de Castro, his argument goes one step further, entailing a radical reassessment of our assumptions about the nature of knowledge.
Taking seriously the idea that shamanic costumes allow the wearer to access planes of existence normally closed to human beings, Pedersen borrows insights from Amerindian 'perspectivism' (Viveiros de Castro 1998b) to entertain the possibility of non-representational ways of knowing which, his ethnography suggests, may also be regarded as states of being. Here the semantic symmetry between 'seeing' and 'knowing' in both European and Mongolian usage is exploited to draw a contrast between two different forms of knowledge. On the one hand 'seeing' is conceived as the construction of mental representations of a (single) world 'out there' (like knowledge in the epistemological sense). On the other, 'seeing', in the perspectivist (and shamanic) sense, is 'an ontological state', defined by inhabiting a particular kind of body (world), in which different kinds of things appear. The shaman's costume enables the shaman to attain otherwise unattainable points of view understood as different (spiritual) identities rather than perspectives in the sense of 'worldviews'.
Whereas Pedersen finds inspiration in Gell's insights, reading his work as an injunction to attend to the ontological potential of fieldwork, Leach teststhe limits of Gell5s theory, ultimately finding it wanting in its conceptualisation of creative agency. Working through Oell's writings in relation to his own ethnographic experience of 'sci-art' collaborations (partnerships orchestrated between artists and scientists), Leach argues that Gell, like his own informants, is unable to imagine a way in which the agency of objects does not ultimately depend on individual (human) creativity.16 Just as the 'collaborations5 between artists and scientists generated tensions and disagreements over just whose skills and knowledge were instantiated in the products of the partnership and subsequently recognised within different arenas of display, so Gell's theorisation consistently refers back to an individual intellect as the source of (artistic and social) agency. While the 'sci-art collaborations5 about which Leach writes were set up with the explicit aim of engendering new forms of creativity through artists5 and scientists5 joint production of artefacts, the collaborators5 preoccupation with questions of personal authorship merely reiterated familiar assumptions about the role of individual agents in creative processes, thus foreclosing the more experimental aspirations of these enterprises.
Together, all these papers serve as concrete illustrations of the potential of the method of Thinking Through Things. The volume picks up the challenge laid down by anthropology's 'quiet revolution5, making explicit the productivity of a methodological focus in reconfiguring anthropology's customary analytical strategies. Indeed, if the volume offers one qualification to the body of work that has inspired it, it is on the grounds that too much priority has been given in this work to theory over the methods that might engender it. After all, unifying, consummate theories can only replace one another. It is perhaps for this reason that an articulated sense of a shared movement is absent within the 'quiet revolution5. An emphasis on methodology seeks to remedy this state of affairs, joining disparate theoretical agendas made exigent through a variety of ethnographic encounters into a coherent experiment unified by a shared method. The positive programme of thinking through things promotes a plurality of theories. For as observed earlier in the discussion, there may be as many ontologies (and therefore novel analytical frames) as there are things to think through - provided we start by heeding the injunction that meanings and artefacts are of an essence.
Notes
1	Ingold similarly notes how the idea of an artefact as the product of the action of culture upon nature 'lies at the back of the minds of anthropologists and archaeologists when they speak of artefacts as items of so-called "material culture" (Ingold 2000: 340).
2	This point about heuristics is not dissimilar to Needham's famous argument that terms like 'kinship' and 'marriage' should be recognised as anthropological 'oddjob words' (Needham 1974: 42, citing Wittgenstein 1958: 43-4). 3	For a programmatic statement of this goal, inspired by the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze, see Viveiros de Castro 2002; cf Deleuze and Guattari 1994; Holbraad 2003.
4	But see B. Latour, 'Discussion: for David Bloor and beyond', 1999:117 for an elaboration of this point, in which he asks what it is 'for an object to play a role if it makes no difference'.
5	We thank Morten Pedersen for clarifying this point.
6	Indeed, this is the fundamental difference between the position adopted here and a more Heideggerean approach. Although Heidegger could be said to countenance the possibility of disparate 'realities', those realities are merely permutations of how 'the world' discloses itself differentially dependent on the combination of one's corporeality and concerns in that world (the concept of 'the finitude of the knowing agent' or 'engaged agency' in Charles Taylor's (1993) terms). Indeed, Ingold's evocation of the 'affordances' of artefacts encapsulates this dilemma (1986). While any artefact may reveal itself to disparate entities differently, there is a limited variety of characteristics to be revealed because the artefact is - simply - one thing in the world - both very much in the singular (see also Viveiros de Castro 1998a: 33-5).
7	Perhaps the analogical inversion in question is best characterised as being metonymic in character, as opposed to metaphoric. A metaphoric inversion of the formula 'difference: similarity: representation: world' can only appear as a contradiction in terms: 'difference: similarity: world: representation'. A metonymic inversion is quite a different procedure, since it involves fusing parts of one side of the analogy with parts of the other. Such a logical operation can be rendered as follows: 'difference: similarity: representation: worldJ二'difference: world'.
8	Note that this is a common denominator between Foucauldian ideas of discourse and phenomenology (see note 6 above).
9	Our appeal to a Deleuzian notion of radical constructivism may appear contradictory considering we have already characterised the method of thinking through things as radically 'essentialist' (see above). But the point is that our essentialism and Deleuze's constructivism are radical in just the same way. For Deleuze, the 'virtual effects' of conceptual creation are equivalent to what constructivists dismissively call 'reality', because the virtual is defined as the plane in which concepts are real (Deleuze 1994: 208; 1990: 4-11). Conversely, we see things as worth thinking through because they are identical to the concepts essentialists would append to them as 'properties' (though see Aristotle 1956: 178-80). So radical constructivism is radical essentialism expressed backwards: if concepts are real then reality is conceptual (see also Deleuze 1993: 41-2).
10	This analysis of course doubled as a socialist polemic against the 'brutish pursuit of individual ends' in France after the Great War, which Mauss attributed to the separation of person from thing in the logic of money and contracts (Parry 1986; GodeHer 1996; Graeber 2001: 155-63).
11	Strathem is, however, careful to note that her own novel concepts do not purport to map onto those of her informants, but are rather produced in the ethnographic encounter. Gell famously noted as much when he observed that The Gender of the Gift was an ethnography of 'system M', 'which you can take to stand for Melanesia or Marilyn, as you wish'(1998: 34).
12	Strathem borrows the terminology from McKim Marriott, who writes that in South Asia, persons or single actors are not thought to be 'individual', that is, indivisible, bounded units, as they are in much of the Western social and psychological theory as well as in common sense. Instead, it appears that persons are generally thought by South Asians to be 'dividual' or divisible (1976:111).
13	In this more recent work, The Anthropology of the Subject, Wagner consummates the point about the analyst's responsibility for conceptual invention in a pandemonium of thinking through things' - New Guinean men's houses, Indra's net, chessmen, Australian flying foxes, the music of Johann Christian Bach, and Eve, all reinvented along with the wheel. Self-consciously written as a joke that readers won't get, the volume plays out the consequences of this responsibility - its strictly irresponsible limits - in authorial performance. If things are concepts then the tautology of stating such an identity occasions a game: take concepts and turn them into things. The 'metaphoric,analysis of things inverted as a literal' reification of concepts. But this Castanedian game goes some steps further than we can here. Straight-laced or dimmer, that is, we insist on getting the joke.
14	The irony here is that in many post-colonial situations, such acts of 'invention' are deemed inauthentic when performed by the 'natives' - a sign of their incorporation into Western modernity (e.g. Kuper 2003 一 see Henare, this volume). Whereas Wagner insists he is following his informants' practice in extending concepts to embrace unforeseen contexts, many commentators presume this capacity to be the purview of Euro-Americans and read all similar efforts by others as signs of acculturation, or as Henare terms it, 'conceptual miscegenation'. The dilemma stems from a fundamental misreading of what Wagner has in mind, as he is not suggesting that invention here is simply a matter of elasticising old concepts for new contexts - a Euro-American epistemological impulse - but rather something more radical, namely that every time concepts are 'extended' in this way they are ipso facto transformed into new meanings 一 an ontological activity (e.g. Wagner 1981: 39).
15	In Artefacts of history', Strathern describes how in Melanesia An artefact or performance grasped for itself is grasped as an image. An image definitively exists out of context; or, conversely it contains its own prior context'(1990: 33).
16	A similar argument is made about 'the tyranny of the subject' in Gell's work, as well as in British social anthropology in general, in Miller (2005a).

'SMUK IS KING'
The action of cigarettes in a Papua New
Guinea prison
Adam Reed
Fieldwork taught me to smoke, or at least how to enjoy the kind of pleasures cigarettes can provide. Prior to my time in Papua New Guinea, I only smoked as they say 'socially5, to overcome nerves at parties and give my hands some occupation. But living on the outskirts of Port Moresby, without a car and in a city where public transport shut down at dusk, smoking became something to do. I would spend my evenings sitting out on the balcony of the house I shared, sweating in the night heat and slowly taking drags from one of the filter cigarettes in the packets I regularly purchased from the local trade store. These evenings, punctuated by little acts of smoking, were dominated by thoughts of the fieldwork day passed and the day to come, but also by a combination of boredom and fear. Victim to my own vivid imagination, I became convinced that my position was unsafe, that it was only a question of time before something nasty happened to me. Rather melodramatically, I would speculate on my chances of lasting the year. Too unsettled to read novels (anthropologists5 solution for wishing themselves elsewhere since Malinowski [1967]), smoking became my main source of consolation. It was for me an inextricable part of conducting fieldwork.
Down in Bomana gaol (my fieldwork site), a fifteen-minute walk away, I discovered that cigarettes could have a still greater significance. For the inmates of this maximum-security installation, holding on average 700 male convicts and remand prisoners, these things, both through their circulation and consumption, were a quintessential feature of prison life. Although tobacco products were illegal in Bomana, whenever they could, men sat down together, rolled a cigarette (smuk), lit it and passed it round. Indeed, like any new inmate, one of the first things I learned was that in gaol 6smuk is king5. This was the case not just because smoking provided inmates with a crucial kind of experience, but also because cigarettes were highly valued objects in the informal prison economy. Of course the significance of cigarettes as artefacts of incarceration is widely reported (cf Morris and Morris 1963; Radford 1968; Heffernan 1972; Carroll 1974; Schifter 1999). Something about the ordeal of this modem form of punishment - 'detentionplus discipline5 (Foucault 1977: 248) - seems to invite inmates, from a range of societies, to smoke and to treat that material with a special kind of reverence. But at Bomana I came to appreciate that smoking was not just a coping mechanism; when men spoke of smuk as king, they were also referring to the fact that this activity provides a constitutive logic for gaol life and the form of inmate society
According to Klein (1995: xi), cigarettes are a crucial integer of modernity, among the most interesting and significant objects of our time. He notes that tobacco's introduction into Europe in the sixteenth century coincided with the invention and spread of printed books, the development of scientific method and a questioning of previously assured theological positions (in this Age of Anxiety, the drug became a commonly prescribed remedy)(1995: 27). Cigarettes went on to accompany workers into the mechanised factories of the Age of Industry (eventually to spread across colonial and postcolonial empires) and to be the companion of the soldier in modem war. As well as the quality of experience that smoking provides, Klein highlights its continuing symbolic and aesthetic properties, as displayed in popular media such as literature, photography and film. He points out the uses of cigarettes as instruments of communication (smoking provides a whole language of gestures and acts) and as objects of gift and trade (see Machen 1926). And finally, he connects them with histories of moral evaluation; once an act of defiance or 'cool', smoking is now frequently an occasion for guilt (1995:17). Particularly in Europe and North America, cigarettes are assigned a negative value, the object of public disapproval and government-backed economic sanction.
Despite such claims (and the secret history of the cigarette as a tool of fieldwork), I believe anthropologists have failed to attend to the actions of what Klein terms this archetypal modem object. The absence is more glaring when one contrasts it with the attention showered on other things. Take the example of money, which is commonly held to be another integer of modernity The widely made claim that money is a thing that expresses the period's dominant forms of logic, consciousness and principles of social organisation (see Simmel1978), and also informs modem debates about aesthetics and symbolisation - most notably, the relation between sign and signified (see Shell1995), has engaged anthropology since its inception. Notions of monetisation - an increasing spread in the number of objects brought into a state of equivalence by modem currency - have provided a context in which anthropologists can explain change and/or the persistence of alternative regimes of value (cf Dalton 1965; Bohannan 1976; Parry and Bloch 1989; Akin and Robbins 1999). Money is held up as the subject of moral evaluations, a vital measure for the state people think they are in. Indeed, however it is judged, the object is held to lie at the centre of social reproduction (see Hart 1986; 2000). In the spirit of the artefact-based anthropology this volume proposes, I want to treat cigarettes as things with an equivalentgenerative status. This means taking the claims of inmates at Bomana seriously. If smuk is king, what kind of reign does it constitute? Can one speak of a cigarette sociality? What are the analytics of smoking? By thinking through cigarettes with the same enthusiasm anthropologists have previously invested in thinking through money, I hope to illustrate one way in which the very substance of things may be construed as irreducible components of thought (see Henare et al., Chapter 1 in this volume). As well as considering the meaning of cigarettes as artefacts of incarceration, this chapter explores the possibility that incarceration may also be an artefact of smoking and the action of cigarettes.
Thinking through cigarettes
One of the points that Klein (1995: 7) makes is that smoking a cigarette is not usually regarded as an act in its own right. Instead it is taken to accompany other more purposeful activities (dining, talking, travelling, reflecting, working). Indeed, smoking is often derided as doing nothing. Vet, as Klein illustrates, the time it takes to smoke a cigarette may be full of significance. Inhaling or exhaling on tobacco smoke can be act of defiance (the factory or office worker and the schoolchild thumbing a nose at the productivity requirements of work [1995: 60]). It can also be a source of consolation. Thus those who must wait, hope or fear (his favourite example is the soldier in wartime) often pull on cigarettes in order to gain composure (1995:137). He states that smoking can provide such individuals with a 'moment of meditation5 (1995:138), periods free of anxiety It can even allow them to open a gap in the time of ordinary experience, to achieve what Klein terms an 'ecstatic standing outside of oneself5 (1995:16). What sometimes appears a strange kind of non-activity therefore has all kinds of potentiality.
Like Klein's wartime soldiers, prisoners at Bomana are defined by a state of waiting. Most obviously convicts must wait tor their date of release and remand inmates for their trial or sentence (indeed the latter are distinguished by that condition, known as wetkot or 'wait court5). The hopes and fears that accompany this experience of detention or confinement occupy the minds of inmates. Indeed, they distinguish their situation on the basis of their enforced separation from people they know, in particular from kin, women and friends.1 Despite the fact that the prison complex lies just outside Port Moresby, the largest urban centre in Papua New Guinea, prisoners complain that they feel isolated, as if lost in a deep forest. Restricted to the dry dusty plateau encompassed by the high perimeter fence, they are unable to view familiar faces or landscapes (prisoners at Bomana come from provinces across the country, though they are usually arrested in Port Moresby). As a technology, incarceration is therefore held not only to make men wait but to have them dwell on what they are missing and the consequences of their absence for people outside the gaol (see Reed 1999; 2003). Thus inmatescomplain that they suffer from 'worry5 (wari), a state of continual anxiety about the welfare of those to whom they owe support. For example, men express concerns about the health of ageing parents (a commonly held fear is that a father or mother will die before the inmate is released), the attitude of partners or wives (inmates fret that women will be unfaithful or desert them), and the education of children (as fathers, inmates worry about how school fees will get paid). The existence of these worries also generates further worries; inmates believe that anxious thoughts can travel, impact on the objects of worry (kin, spouse, children), thus damaging the minds of loved ones outside the gaol and making them ill. In this sense, the distress caused to inmates (some men are said to be driven crazy [longlong\ by anxiety) is but one of the outcomes if worry is left unchecked.
In this situation, smoking is held to be crucial, acknowledged as an activity vital and sufficient on its own terms. While inmates draw satisfaction from the fact that the act is subversive, against prison rules (and also the health warnings issued by national government), they are far more impressed by what they identify as its relieving capacities. The ceremony of huddling together, either in a comer of the cell or up tight against the yard fence, pinching the tobacco along a strip of old newspaper and rolling it into a cigarette, which is set alight and passed from one cupped hand to another, provides them with a much-needed form of occupation. In fact inmates talk of smoking 'shortening time5 (sotim taim) or making the prison day pass more quickly.2 This is especially the case because the majority of prisoners at Bomana have nothing to do (only a small number of convicts are assigned to work parties); men spend their days inside their barrack room style cell blocks or outside in the cell yards, bored and with few diversions to occupy their attention. However, the true significance of the activity is held to lie in the effects it has on the mind of the smoker. For the whole period of sharing a smuk is animated by the promise of escaping the pains of confinement. Dragging on a cigarette, men claim that the smoke they inhale enters the body and makes their head spin. This action is held to impact upon inmates5 capacity to remember, to briefly numb or 'kill5 what they term their 'memory sense5 (kilim dispeal memori sens blong yu). More particularly, the smoke is said to prevent them from thinking and worrying about the persons and places they left behind when they entered Bomana (yu smuk na yu no tingting long autsait). This ability to make men 'lose thoughts5 (lus tingting) or forget is what makes the activity such a valued experience. As smokers, inmates learn to love cigarettes because they kill their memory and therefore change their state of mind.3
Central to the value ascribed to smoking is the recognition by inmates of where agency in this activity lies. While smoking can be read as a form of resistance, it is not necessarily taken to demonstrate the agency of prisoners. In fact the activity is usually figured as an event in which something happens to them. Men in Bomana claim to be vitally acted upon by cigarettes, subjectto the actions of tobacco when set alight and smoked. Indeed, "smuk is king5 precisely because in inmates5 minds it is the dominant actor in prison. This is perhaps best highlighted by what happens to prisoners when they are forced to try and live without cigarettes. During such periods men claim to 'suffer' greatly (pl man suffa tru long smuk). Instead of walking around the yards, inmates sleep all day in their cells and complain of feeling sick and lethargic. Worries overcome them, so that they stop talking to one another and become quick to temper (as inmates say, 'if there are no cigarettes there are no stories5 \no gat smuk no gat storiQ. In contrast, when cigarettes reappear again the mood changes dramatically. As inmates told me, the first drag opens their eyes. Once the smuk is finished, they get up, wash themselves and leave the cell. Men start to smile, crack jokes and exchange stories. Although this experience might be discounted as the symptoms of tobacco addiction, prisoners who smoked outside the gaol insist that they have never felt like that before. In Bomana they claim to be constantly 'hungry for cigarettes5 (hanger long smuk); men live for the next smoke, thinking and dreaming on how to get it. This desire, which is only exacerbated when a cigarette is found and consumed, is often said to completely dominate their thoughts. Inmates like to point to the example of the 'cigarette man5 (cigimari), a prisoner who is so desperate to smoke that he is prepared to sell his food rations and uniform, and to offer his body for sexual services. In this case, cigarettes appear to consume the man, to make him act with them in mind. While the cigarette man is a tragic-comic figure in Bomana, other inmates acknowledge that cigarettes are also the cause of their actions.
The most immediate outcome or artefact of smoking is prison sociality By killing memory or allowing inmates to forget the debt they owe to people outside the gaol, the activity creates the possibility of identifying alternative sets of relations (smoking enables them to stand outside that part of themselves composed before incarceration). In particular, it allows prisoners to recognise bodies of men that are present and active in gaol. As well as the outcome of the negative act of forgetting, these forms are positively elicited by practices of smoking. When new inmates arrive at Bomana they are processed at reception and then led down to the guardhouse next to the cell yards. There, warders count and search them, before opening the gates and ushering them in. Usually too scared to venture inside a cell, these prisoners stand about in the yards waiting to see what happens. Gradually other inmates crowd round them, inspecting their appearance and making inquiries about their background. One by one individuals are invited to enter a cell, sit down in a comer and share a cigarette. By this act the new prisoner is acknowledged as either a gang mate or wantok ('one language5 mate, an elastic term for anyone from the same language group, province or region). Indeed, from the first rolled cigarette an inmate smokes, his relationship to the important bodies of men in gaol is laid out. By definition, a gang mate or wantok is a smoking partner, someone who occupies the same cell comer(inmates divide the space of cells by hanging blankets to create screened rooms; this is where bodies of men sleep and smoke) and who shares cigarettes.
Not only the consumption but also the exchange of cigarettes draws inmates together (Klein 1995:137 suggests that 'cigarettes give the gift of giving5).4 The composition of a gang, tor instance, is shaped by the way these objects flow. Senior members or 'big boys' (bikboi) are simply those gang mates who have found a means of smuggling tobacco into gaol (usually by successfully identifying a warder who will take a bribe and smuggle on their behalf). They are responsible for distributing cigarettes and keeping gang mates supplied. If their source of tobacco dries up, they immediately lose that status. One of the first things that a new prisoner learns from his gang mates is not to ask for or accept cigarettes from inmates he doesn't know (no kan askim mangi long smuk em lo blong haus kalabus). Gangs in Bomana are differentiated from one another on the basis of men not sharing cigarettes. Indeed, competition between them is largely measured by their relative success in smuggling and distributing tobacco; to accept a cigarette from a man in a different gang would therefore risk ruining one's own gang name (bagarapim nem blong gang long mipeld). Outside their gang mates, men only offer cigarettes aggressively, to taunt their enemies or persuade them to switch sides (it is also possible to smoke aggressively; cell fights often start because gang mates deliberately smoke in front of others). Like its 'big boys', the status of gangs is precarious, measured by the amount of cigarettes that at any one time are consumed and circulated in its name.
Whether gang mates or wantok, cigarettes are the things that allow men to demonstrate who they know and how. Without smuk, inmates say that they would have no way of making friends (sapos smuk no gat pren i no gutpela tumas, sapos gat smuk gat plenty preri). Smoking is therefore the constitutive form of sociability (to smoke alone is regarded as a pure act of negation). This is the case whether the relation evinced places persons in like positions or complementary opposition. Inmates sometimes give cigarettes, for example, in order to open a debt that they know the recipient cannot return. Here, the acceptance of a cigarette can leave a man vulnerable to future demands (prisoners talk of the donor claiming 'tax' back); confronted with such a request (mi givim yu smuk na yu givim mi wanem), he may be forced to perform menial tasks such as washing clothes, sweeping a cell comer, collecting meals or even submitting to sexual assault. For men at Bomana, then, smoking and the action of cigarettes provide an orienting aesthetic, the constraining form by which persons and sets of relations are ordered.
But the agency of cigarettes and the claim that 6smuk is king' is most dramatically illustrated for inmates by a different attribute. Upon entering Bomana, new prisoners are amazed to discover that cigarettes have taken on the role and function of currency5 Any informal transactions in the gaol are conducted with 'cigarette money' (smukmoni). Thus, a single cigarette or 'roll' may be used to purchase a can of tinned meat, a tube of toothpaste, aplate of cooked rice, a face towel or a bar of soap. Two rolls may buy an inmate a pair of sunglasses and four rolls may buy him half a bag of sugar. As well as hand-rolled cigarettes, men treat 'packets' of tobacco as a unit of this currency With one packet they may purchase a pair of trousers or shoes and with two packets a watch or radio. In this way units of rolled and unrolled tobacco are seen to draw all objects into a common scale; a state demonstrated by the fact that those few inmates who do not smoke in Bomana still seek out ways of gaining cigarettes in order to make transactions.
In this economy what strikes new inmates most of all is the reversal of value between cigarettes and national currency (in Papua New Guinea notes are known as kina and coins as toed).6 They find it astonishing that an object so inexpensive and ordinary outside the gaol, one they had previously given little thought to, can displace the authority of notes and coins (although the possession of kina and toea is prohibited by prison rules, this money is widely available; in fact notes and coins are far easier to smuggle into gaol than bulky pouches of tobacco). As inmates like to point out, a pouch of rolling tobacco, costing 95 toea in the trade store outside the gaol, may be purchased in Bomana tor 6 kina (during my fieldwork in 1995 the exchange rate was roughly 1 kina to the US dollar). From that pouch an inmate may divide the tobacco into three packets, each one of which he can sell tor 2 kina. To them, national currency is suddenly made cheap; not only is it unsuitable as a medium of exchange in the general prison economy, it is without value in the market for tobacco until the holder finds a warder willing to smuggle or an inmate willing to sell. In fact prisoners claim that for the first time in their lives they have too much cash, that they hold kina and toea at the moment they lose the power to spend it. Outside the gaol, in particular in Port Moresby, men claim to devote their energies to acquiring national currency Everything, from the food one eats to the clothes one wears, the house one rents or buys, the bus one travels on and the beer one drinks, must be purchased using notes and coins. Indeed, inmates assert that in the city 'money talks' (moni tok), the need for it directs their actions. Many of them actually claim they are in gaol because of national currency; the presence of kina and toea is said to make young men in the city steal, become 'fools' for crime.7 Entering Bomana, a place where this currency exists but men say that 'cigarettes talk' (smuk tok), is therefore a considerable shock. The experience means that inmates tend to draw out the actions and properties of cigarettes by comparing and contrasting them to the actions and properties of national currency
According to Strathem (1999: 97) one of the ways in which people in Papua New Guinea think through national currency is by taking on board its attribute of divisibility In particular, what impresses them is the ability of the inscriptions or drawings on the surface of notes and coins to represent abstract units of value, an account unconnected to the enumerable form of the thing itself (any kina note includes four reproductions of its value innumber form ['2'] and one in letter form ['Two Kina5]).8 This divisible quality is held to have specific effects on the constitution of money users. Indeed, the people from the Western Highlands that Strathem worked with complained of kina and toea dividing their minds. Unlike traditional wealth items such as pearl shells or pigs, notes and coins are never transacted whole with a single purpose (1999: 96). Some amount of national currency is always held back in the imagination of the money holder. Thus, while the pearl shell is a single, non-divisible thing whose exchange elicits a specific relationship, the capacity of kina and toea to display the objective attribute of a number encourages people to envisage all their relationships at once. Not surprisingly, this creates some anxiety, a sense that debts must be returned more quickly and exchange accelerated.
Cigarettes, however, are not subject to the same mathematics as kina and toea (or traditional wealth items); they provide quite different material conditions tor counting. As a currency, smuk lacks any form of inscription. There is no opportunity for individual rolls or packets of tobacco to stand tor multiples or abstract units of account. A single cigarette is always 'one5; this is the case whether it is rolled long and thin or short and fat. Although the size of the roll does not alter its numerical value, this lack of equivalence does mean that it is impossible tor inmates to predict how many cigarettes there are in one packet of tobacco (the amount can vary from five to ten rolls).9 Like cigarettes, the size of a packet can vary too (it can be half or one fifth of a trade store pouch). While these packets divide, albeit vicariously, into rolls, rolls cannot be accumulated and converted back into packets (however many cigarettes an inmate possesses the number never becomes a packet). As an alternative to kina and toea, this currency therefore acts without the calculative property of divisibility, a fact that inmates regard as a real advantage.
Indeed, it is precisely the non-divisible aspect of cigarettes that makes them such an appealing prison currency For unlike kina and toea, smuk acts as a poor instrument of memory;10 it does not keep track of the same exchanges or register the same genealogies.11 Part of the problem with national currency in Bomana is that it risks activating inmates5 memories of transactions outside the gaol and of debts they have yet to return (holding notes and coins reminds them of the money owed tor children's school fees, of the rent payment due to their wives, the money they promised their father tor prescription glasses, etc.). By contrast, cigarettes help inmates to forget those thoughts. Not only can the act of smoking alleviate men's worries, the fact that the money form is specific to Bomana and that it lacks divisible qualities means it carries no record of these relationships (those that stretch back prior to incarceration). As a token, cigarettes only register exchanges between inmates; those debts that they know can be returned.
But the most obvious way in which cigarettes differ from kina and toea is in the basis for their valuation. First and foremost they are held as objects to consume rather than exchange; indeed, it is the desire to smoke them that provides the authority for this money form. In this way cigarettes contradict what are usually held to be the conventional rules of currency According to Robbins and Akin (1999: 4), for example, modem money and indigenous currencies share two distinct qualities (first identified by Simmel1978). First of all, as objects they cannot be consumed; users must pass currency on, convert it into something else, before they enjoy it. Second, because these objects are unable to come to rest in consumption, they must circulate continuously and gain their value as a means of exchange (1999: 4-5).12 In fact Robbins and Akin assert that the significance of all currencies in Melanesia (and by implication elsewhere) extends from this ability of the objects to flow between persons and to evoke permanence and continuity (1999:18-19). While this explanation makes sense of the actions inmates ascribe to kina and toea (objects that resist consumption and therefore accrue value exclusively from circulation), it does little to elucidate the actions of cigarettes. In Bomana the exchange and flow of smuk is certainly important (responsible for shaping the composition of bodies of men); however; the value of these things cannot be reasonably separated from the moment of their eventual consumption.
In a straightforward sense the pull to take cigarettes out of circulation and smoke them, literally to bum the currency, leads to bouts of deflation and periods of money shortage. When the tobacco stock entering Bomana falls (after breakouts or prison fights, for instance, inmates are locked up all day inside their cells and their weekend visits are suspended, making it almost impossible for tobacco to be smuggled), cigarettes almost completely stop circulating;13 most men will smoke whatever they have rather than use them to purchase any available items for sale. The desire to consume smuk and the difficulties associated with smuggling mean that the informal prison economy appears to suffer regular crises of currency - too often, it has goods without the means of exchange. Despite this fact, cigarettes remain inmates' currency of choice. For them, smoking and the act of consumption do not threaten the money form, but they do draw out its unique materiality
According to Foster (1999: 215-16), Papua New Guineans do not generally distinguish between kina and toea on the basis of the material differences between paper and metal. Nor do they worry about the increasing gap 'between the money form's inscription (its role as signifier of value) and its relative value as an object of substance (a division now exaggerated by the increasing electronification of national currency).14 Indeed, he claims that people are less concerned with the specific medium of exchange and more with the ways in which the money form circulates to establish the distinctions crucial to social reproduction (hence paper, metal and electric digits can symbolise the same relationship and all stand for an abstract unit of value)(1999: 217). At Bomana it is certainly true that the attention inmates give to the materiality of cigarettes does not result in themsuddenly differentiating between the substantive matter of kina and toea. But it does lead them to distinguish cigarettes as a currency whose substance vitally matters. For in gaol the reproduction of social relations depends precisely on the money form possessing the right material properties (no substitute will do). These must fit the requirements of exchange, but more importantly those of consumption (it is only by smoking tobacco that men can kill memory and thus survive the pains of confinement). Another reason, then, that inmates view notes and coins as such a poor money form in Bomana is that they never come to rest in the same way as cigarettes.
While, as Keane (2001:69) points out, the irreducible materiality of notes and coins can always make national currencies vulnerable to slippage (undermine the authorising stamp of the state on its face),15 this is not the same as saying that a money form is founded upon an appreciation of the object's material properties. From the beginning, the matter of cigarettes defines its status as prison currency This attention on what appears the untranscended materiality of smuk makes appear a fetish object; like gold, tobacco provides the basis for a highly sensuous currency According to Pels (1998: 99), the fetish 'maintains an aesthetic value that radically distinguishes it as a material object from the subject it confronts' (〇f. Pietz 1985). For him, this kind of object status provides a useful position against the treatment of materiality in present-day cultural and social theory; in particular what he regards as the hegemony of constructivism (1998:112). Instead of things being treated as human product, he wants to consider those times when they appear to act and emit their own messages (1998: 94). The fetish object is not animated by something foreign to it - human intention or social meaning - but by a spirit that seems its own. That spirit is not held to reside in matter, but rather it appears as the spirit of matter (1998:101).From this perspective, material seems to mould persons, to constitute them as subjects who desire and suffer; the object is too powerful a presence to be just the sign of something else (1998:113). At Bomana inmates identify what might be taken as the spirit in cigarettes 一 its role as medium of exchange and token (the same spirit they identify in kina and toed), but they also highlight what might be taken as the spirit of cigarettes - their role as consumable matter. They can identify no equivalent spirit in the substance of national currency or indeed in other indigenous currencies (prisoners resist analogies to traditional wealth items). For them, cigarettes are without complement, they are distinguished by their transcendence of what they previously expected money to do.
Indeed, cigarettes in gaol have quite different qualities from solid-specie or gold-based monies. Whereas the sensuousness of gold is linked to its durability, the material properties of cigarettes disappear at the point of consummation. For their authority is based upon a sacrifice of matter, or at least its conversion into a different material form. As inmates share a smuk, the solid thing (tobacco and rolling paper) is gradually turned into fragilematter (ash) and nonsolid matter (smoke), which then enters the body, circulates and exits, to dissipate in the air. If prisoners at Bomana regard the material of cigarettes as exerting its own agency, then, as subjects or actors (smuk is king), these things also consume themselves. As well as frustrating attempts to own or appropriate them (Klein 1995: 31),16 the self^consuming quality of cigarettes makes them a unique kind of fetish object. Smuk moulds men by having them transform its material state (it is the smoke of the cigarette, not its solid matter, that acts upon the mind of inmates). From this simple action, life in Bomana unfurls; as far as prisoners are concerned, it is the point from which everything starts and to which everything returns.
Conclusion
I	hope that in this chapter I have begun to suggest some of the ways in which the material properties of things can become involved in the production of meaning. The ways in which inmates at Bomana think through cigarettes surely demonstrates the kind of artefact-based anthropology this volume proposes. It would, tor example, be hard to insist that in this case meanings are fundamentally separated from their material manifestations (see Henare et QL, Chapter 1 in this volume). In inmates5 eyes, the organisation of prison life is premised on the action of smoking; when cigarettes are taken away those social forms break down and men withdraw from contact with each other. Rather than imagining that they infuse cigarettes with meaning, prisoners insist that cigarettes give their lives significance. 'Smuk is king5 because it makes men act with these things in mind. However, it is worth pointing out that as far as prisoners are concerned this state distinguishes cigarettes from other kinds of objects; in Bomana only one artefact is an irreducible component of thought. Indeed, the reign of smuk necessitates the devaluation of other things. Most notably, in gaol inmates stop thinking through kina and toea; they no longer act with national currency in mind. An artefact-based anthropology then would also have to acknowledge the consequences for other things of one material substance emitting its own meanings.
Further, the action of cigarettes is historically contingent. Just as I lost interest in smoking when I returned from the field, so inmates know that once they are released from Bomana the activity will cease to organise their lives. Outside the gaol cigarettes revert to the status of one among many trade store commodities; once again it is money or national currency that talks. In fact the value of cigarettes in gaol and the autonomy of the informal prison economy ultimately depend on kina and toea remaining desirable to someone. It is only by bribing certain warders with cash that a significant amount of tobacco can be successively smuggled. And while the vast majority of inmates switch their attention from national currency to cigarettes, a few men remain focused on gathering kina and toea. These prisoners, known as * dealer men5, have privileged access to smuggled tobacco. As well as distributing cigarettes among gang mates or language mates, they hold some back and secretly sell to other inmates. By continuing to think through kina and toea, they are able to accumulate vast sums of money (I was told that the most successful of them leave Bomana with bundles of notes worth up to 6,000 kina). From their perspective, it is the meanings emitted by national currency that makes sense of smoking and the action of cigarettes.

Notes
1	Foucault (1977: 257) is suspicious of any claim that relegates the modern penal experience to the moment of confinement, to what he terms the legalistic definition of punishment as 'mere deprivation of liberty'. For him the penitentiary is crucially detention plus discipline; it is this extra judicial aspect of imprisonment that he believes defines (and constructs) the prison subject. However, for inmates at Bomana the kind of subject they become in jail is held to be first and foremost an outcome of the constraint of detention - being cut off and forcibly isolated from people one knows. This is the experience that counts.
2	The role of smoking in helping inmates to pass time is well observed in other prison environments. Schifter (1999: 82), for instance, who worked in Costa Rican prisons, notes that consuming cigarettes is one of the few forms of consolation available to inmates. For them, smoking serves as a method of 'time control' in a situation where they lack power over the most basic exercises - when to eat, sleep or wash.
3	According to Mosko (1999), men among the Mekeo people of Papua New Guinea drink beer in order to change their state of mind and do things they might otherwise not. Indeed, he compares the state of alcoholic intoxication to sorcery 一 a condition in which one's state of being is affected by the negative actions of another. However; Mosko says that beer consumption serves as a kind of 'autosorcery', a belief that through intoxicants one can bring an altered state upon oneself
4	Klein (1995:137) emphasises the role of cigarettes in the gift-giving economy of soldiers; in wartime, he points out, cigarettes not only help soldiers to deal with their fear, the objects allow them to exercise generosity and demonstrate kinship as comrades.
5	As Klein (1995:136) points out, prison is not the only place and time where cigarettes take on the attributes of money. During the Allied reoccupation of Europe in the Second World War, for instance, American soldiers could buyanything they wanted from the local population using their cigarette rations. More recently, during the Romanian revolution at the end of the Cold War, the American cigarette brand 'Kent' for a brief period replaced the national currency as the medium of exchange in Bucharest.
6	Prior to Papua New Guinea's independence in 1975, the state currency was dollars and cents. The new names for monetary units (kina is an indigenous term for pearl shell and toea for arm shell) were intended to signify the new nation and suggest continuities with traditional forms of wealth (Foster 1998: 71).
7	BergendorfF (1996) reports that the Mekeo people, who live near Port Moresby and are regular visitors to the city, recognise the power that money has over them. They claim that money can detrimentally affect the mind and cause mental illness. He quotes one Mekeo villager as saying:'Money problems. Some of them think, they do not have enough (money); some of them think they want to get more. Or, some of them think, they want to do something, but let's say, they do not have money to do that thing. But they think of money and then they get that (mental sickness)'(145).
8	Shell(1995:131)argues that the act of numerical inscription is also crucial to the development of Western art; some artists, for instance, regard the first coin impressed with the numeral'2' as the earliest example of conceptual art.
9	As Klein (1995: 30) points out, the material conditions of counting may be very different if cigarettes are mechanically manufactured instead of being hand- rolled. Here, each cigarette is identical to another and interchangeable. Klein suggests that in this situation cigarettes lose their uniqueness and come to stand for an abstract generality, to only have a collective status as like units and thus to have number belong to their identity (30-1).
10	Hart (2000: 234) talks of money as a 'memory bank', a means of ensuring that information about the transactions between people is recorded and kept in circulation.
11	Foster (1999: 230) argues that kina and toea can be seen as the 'skin of the state', a site where government and the nation and people's relation to those bodies is made visible. Indeed, as he points out, at Independence (in 1975) government education programmes encouraged its citizens to understand the nation as a community of money users. Much was made of the fact that as a medium of exchange these notes and coins were valid translocally co-extensive with the newly sovereign country's borders (Foster 1998: 70).
12	Criticisms of national currency in Papua New Guinea sometimes centre on the idea that kina and toea are less effective means of keeping track of exchanges. Thus Errington and Gewertz (1995: 54) discuss the distinctions drawn by Duke of Vbrk Islanders between shell money or diwara and national currency They point out that while notes and coins are denigrated as 'light' or inconsequential objects, unable to sustain enduring ties, shell money is presented as 'heavy', capable of embodying genealogies and generating future sets of relations (1995: 58).
13	In his study of the economic organisation of a Second World War POW camp, Radford (1968: 403) is struck by the fact that the camp market, in which cigarettes act as currency, comes into existence without labour or production. With all goods supplied by the Red Cross and family food parcels, the emphasis of economic practice lies in the exchange and the media of exchange. At Bomana most goods (including rations of food) are supplied by the prison service, but unlike the POW camp, where cigarettes arrive free and approved, tobacco is prohibited. Inmates must work to smuggle it into jail.
14	Foster (1998: 66) states that colonial and postcolonial governments in Papua New Guinea actively encouraged the idea that the matter of national currencywas of no consequence. In contrast to traditional wealth items (taro, pigs), a colonial government information booklet stressed that notes and coins do not decay or corrupt; if soiled or dirty individual pieces of money can be exchanged at the bank for clean, new ones. Foster claims that this message was motivated by a government fear that people might embrace notes and coins the wrong way - as material whose intrinsic properties explain its efficacy (66). However, there was some contradiction in this strategy of colonial education. In order to encourage saving, the government emphasised the fragility of individual notes and coins and the importance of depositing them in the bank for safekeeping; here they acknowledged the significance of money's materiality (67).
15	Nihill(1989) provides an example of kina and toea being revalued on the basis of their material properties. Among the Anganen people of the Southern Highlands, kina notes have entered into ceremonial modes of transaction and appear to have taken on the value previously assigned to wealth items. The Anganen associate coins and small denominations of notes with the female sphere of household consumption. Larger notes, in particular the 20 kina note, are associated with the males sphere of public exchange. Anganen men emphasise the newness or crispness of 20 kina notes, and their red colouration, treating them as directly interchangeable with pearl shells.
16	Referencing the critique by Sartre of conceptions of property under capitalism, Klein (1995: 31)points out that the smoker of cigarettes cannot easily claim that CI am what I have'. Unlike the pipe smoker, for instance, whose pipe still remains a palpable object after smoking, the cigarette smoker loses the thing he claims in the act of appropriation.

TAONGA MAORI
Encompassing rights and property in New
Zealand
Amiria Henare
Ownership gathers things momentarily to a point by locating them in the owner, halting endless dissemination, effecting an identity.
(Strathem 1999:177)
There is no specific term in Maori for the word value.[...] [T]he Maori idea of value is incorporated into the [. . .] term 'taonga' - a treasure, something precious; hence an object of good or value. The object or end valued may be tangible or intangible; material or spiritual.
(Maori Marsden in Royal 2003: 38)
This paper examines a particular intervention in conceptions of ownership on the part of Maori people in New Zealand. It concerns a claim that asserts Maori interests in a range of specific things singled out as objects of legal attention, among them the products of new technologies that the law has only recently, or not yet even, decided may be owned. These interests are asserted on the basis that the things concerned are taonga, a Maori term which may be glossed as 'a treasure, something precious; hence an object of good or value5. A taonga might equally be a historic whalebone weapon, the Maori language, a native plant or a body of knowledge; distinctions between the material and the ephemeral are not relevant here. Nor are ideas about animate versus inanimate entities; women and children may be exchanged as taonga, and taonga such as woven cloaks are often held as ancestors or instantiations of ancestral effect.
Marcel Mauss first brought the concept of taonga to international attention in his seminal 'Essai sur le don5 (1925), published in translation as The Gift in 1954. Referring to a letter written in the 18908 by the Maori elder Tamati Ranapiri, later translated by museum ethnologist Elsdon Best,1 Mauss argued that when a taonga or treasured possession is exchanged, it carries with it hau, 'the spirit of the gift5, an animate force binding those involved in the transaction -persons and things - into a cycle of reciprocity impelling the receiver tomake a return. But whereas fbr Mauss, taonga appeared as mere 'vehicles' fbr the hau and mana of the gifting party and his kin-group, Ranapiri himself expressed things rather differently:
The taonga that I received fbr these taonga (which came from you) must be returned to you. It would not be fair (tikd) on my part to keep these taonga fbr myself, whether they were desirable (rawe) or undesirable (kind). I must give them to you because they are a hau of the taonga that you gave me. If I kept this other taonga for myself, serious harm might befall me, even death. This is the nature of the hau, the hau of personal property, the hau of the taonga.
(in Mauss 1990:11,emphasis added)
According to Ranapiri, one taonga exchanged for another does not simply carry the hau of the gift, it is its hau, translated elsewhere by Best as 'the vital essence or life principle'(1900:189). There is a precise identity, in other words, between thing and spirit, aspects which Mauss separated out in his analysis. I make this point to emphasise that the concept of taonga is not in fact translatable into European terms, legal or otherwise. My purpose is to examine the implications of this untranslatability, in particular the strategies Maori people are developing to insist on the enduring relevance and integrity of their own concepts today within a predominantly anglophone society
Maori rights in their taonga are specifically protected in the terms of the Treaty of Waitangi, the document by which New Zealand was made a British colony in the mid-nineteenth century, but which has never been fully recognised in law. The Maori version of the Treaty, first signed in the Bay of Islands in 1840, was constituted as an exchange of promises between Maori chiefs and the British Crown. In Article 1 of the Treaty, the chiefs agreed that Queen Victoria could establish a governor in New Zealand. In Article 2, the Queen's representatives promised that she would uphold the tino rangati- ratanga or absolute authority of the chiefs over their lands, living places, me 〇 ratou taonga katoa, a phrase often translated as 'and all their valuables'. At the same time the chiefs 'gifted' to the Queen the right to control te hokonga (usually translated as the buying and selling) of land. In Article 3, the Queen promised to protect Maori people and give them the same rights as her own people in England.2
All the articles of the Treaty have been contentious, not least that which guarantees Maori tino rangatiratanga over their taonga and land. Much legal, historical, and anthropological debate has focused upon this commitment in recent years, and the claim I will be thinking through is positioned in the thick of this scholarly action. At one level, dispute centres on the validity of Maori claims to ownership of taonga in a variety of spheres. Yet more is at stake here than property rights alone. Some who question Maori interests do so on the grounds that over two centuries of cultural engagement and intermarriagewith Europeans have removed from Maori their privileged status as an indigenous people, rendering even their claims to a distinctive identity suspect. It is increasingly held that globalisation and life in a twenty-first century, first-world society have adulterated authentic Maori identity, leaving a hybrid, postcolonial relic in its place. In the course of this paper I will explore how anthropologists are providing support for this view by analysing cultural change through the lens of 'biological kinship. The logic of whaka- papa ('genealogy') — a key organising principle in Maori 一 as we shall see, offers a rather different view.
In asserting the ongoing vitality of concepts such as taonga, their ability to generate and encompass new forms, therefore, Maori are insisting on the persistence and creativity of a distinctively Maori register of value. More than just a pre-emptive strike against the commoditisation of specific objects, the particular claim I will'be looking at insists on the enduring vitality of Maoriness, and may be seen as an attempt to continue weaving into the kaupapa or body of law in New Zealand a distinctively Maori way of conceiving the nature of persons and things. As I hope to articulate in the course of this chapter; the claim's anticipated effect derives in part from distinctive assumptions about the workings of language, particularly written or printed text. In fact, as I will argue, the claim itself may be understood as a certain kind of taonga, one whose contours are thrown into relief by the very contrast between divergent conceptions of reality.
Wai 262: a 'cultural property9 claim
Over the past century, a great deal of Maori energy has been devoted to seeking reparations tor land and resources expropriated in the course of colonisation. Although the Treaty of Waitangi was declared a legal nullity by a New Zealand court not long after its signing, Maori people have consistently called tor its terms to be upheld, tor successive governments' failures in protecting Maori interests to be addressed, and tor adequate reparations to be made for land, taonga and resources lost in the colonial process. In 1975 the Waitangi Tribunal was established to assess such claims, which, under its remit, must demonstrate a specific breach (or breaches) of the Treaty of Waitangi, the document signed by Maori leaders and representatives of the British Crown in 184〇.
The particular claim through which I will be thinking is known as Wai 262, being the 262nd claim submitted to the Tribunal since its foundation. Wai 262 was lodged by a group of Maori representing six iwi or tribes, and asserts Maori interests in taonga including indigenous flora and fauna, genetics and genetics derivatives, silica sands and cultural motifs, as well as items identified (by the claimants and others) as 'traditional' objects of value. This latter category includes the Maori language, Maori knowledge or matauranga in general and the knowledge, skilled practice and artefacts ofprocesses including carving and weaving. Interests in these objects of value are asserted with reference to Article 2 of the Treaty, in particular the section guaranteeing to Maori te tino rangatiratanga over their lands, living places, me 〇 ratou taonga katoa. The text of the claim, and evidence submitted in its support, incorporates conceptual threads drawn both from British and New Zealand jurisprudence and from Maori principles and thinking. These are woven together into a kaupapa or fabric in the form of a legal document, the Statement of Claim, in which diverse conceptions are laid alongside one another and held in tension. While the term 'ownership' is not used, the claim specifically names 'intellectual property and property rights' among the 'indigenous, cultural and customary heritage rights' for which it seeks recognition.
Seen in historical perspective, Wai 262 follows a series of unexpected commodifications of things that were not originally conceived as abstractable from an all-encompassing fabric of relations. First, in the colonial period, land was appropriated and sold in transactions that (at least at first) confounded Maori notions of economic and social propriety. More recently, government plans to sell resources including fishing quotas, petroleum rights and the radio spectrum used in telecommunications, took Maori (and others) by surprise. Each of these moves resulted in claims to the WaitangirFribunal for a Maori share of the pie. In the Fisheries Claim (Wai 307), for example, a number of tribes were successful in gaining a substantial share of commercial ocean fisheries, whereas claims for a stake in the radio spectrum and petroleum rights (Wai 776 and 796 respectively), though upheld by the Tribunal, were rejected by government. In the case of Wai 262, it seems that Maori are pre-empting the process, getting in ahead of the intellectual property lawyers and legislators who would define how things should be objectified. It is in this sense that the claim appears as an assertion of distinctively Maori values, and of a mode of objectification in which different kinds of things appear. Yet while, as with the Fisheries Claim, people seem prepared to accept that Maori value rights in resources defined by the authorities (and by the claimants themselves) as 'traditional', they are less willing to extend to Maori the capacity to encompass newness, the artefacts of technological innovation, within their relational scheme. To some commentators indeed, the claim appears little short of ludicrous in the scope of its demands (e.g. Milne 2005).
The matter is complicated by the fact that Maori clearly participate in more than one register of value - that which produces commodities as well as that which is peopled by taonga. As a report on the claim makes explicit:
The concepts of te ao Maori [. . .] cannot be assimilated to categories of real, personal and intellectual property rights of ownership and/or possession in respect of tangible or intangible items with economic exchange value. The tension of living with these incompatibilities is a daily fact of life for Maori.
(Williams 2001:14) I am interested in the relationship between these apparently incommensurable positions. According to many commentators in New Zealand, the two are inherently opposed - the more one values commodities, the less Maori one becomes, as to claim an attachment to the artefacts of global capitalism is seen as reneging upon a commitment to the world of taonga. Yet in Wai 262, one perspective is encompassed by the other, as property rights are subsumed in taonga relations. Let me give a brief example of this encom- passment in action. The following paragraph is drawn from the amended Wai 262 Statement of Claim, submitted to the WaitangirFribunal in October 2001 by counsel for claimants on behalf of the Ngati Kuri, Te Rarawa and Ngati Wai iwi or tribes. Although the claim is written mostly in English, many readers will not understand parts of it as they are given in Maori, often without translation. I will return to this point shortly:
The [Wai 262] claim relates to te tino rangatiratanga of Ngati Kuri, Te Rarawa and Ngati Wai in respect of indigenous flora and fauna me 〇 ratou taonga katoa (and all their treasures) within their respective tribal rode, including but not limited to te reo, matauranga, knowledge systems, laws, customs and values, whakairo, waahi tapu, biodiversity, natural resources, genetics and genetics derivatives, Maori symbols, images, designs, and their use and development and associated indigenous, cultural and customary heritage rights (including intellectual property and property rights) in relation to such taonga. Taonga5 in this claim refers to all elements of the claimants5 estates, both material and non-material, tangible and intangible.
(Wai 262 Second Amended Statement of Claim on behalf of Ngati Kuri, Te Rarawa and Ngati Wai, 20 October 2001)
The claim itself thus brings a range of objects, including intellectual property and property rights in general, into the sphere of taonga, encompassing them under the heading me 〇 ratou taonga katoa (glossed here as 'and all their treasures5). This is achieved both explicitly, through articulating this assertion in a combination of English and Maori terms, and performatively, in asserting the mana or authority of Maori concepts and terminology by leaving them largely untranslated in the mainly English text. From this position, at least, incommensurability no longer appears as a problem, as taonga and commodities are brought into a single generative sphere. Later in this paper I will explore this encompassment and its significance for analyses of cultural dynamism and change.
The Treaty of Waitangi as a taonga
In Maori terms, the kaupapa (underlying principle) of all the claims made to the Waitangi rFribunal is the Treaty itself Maori peoplehave come to regard the Treaty as a taonga, as a solemn token of convenant, as 'he kawenata tapu5 (a sacred convenant) and as a bringing together of Maori custom and English law.
(Waitangi Tribunal 1992: 2.13)
The foundation of the Waitangi Tribunal, and the various claims which it has so far assessed, have occasioned heated public and scholarly debate about the terms of the Treaty, the circumstances surrounding its signing and the intentions of those who signed it. As already mentioned, much of this discussion has centred on the clause in the Treaty that guarantees to Maori te tino rangatiratanga over their taonga, and which is the focus of the Wai 262 claim. Counsel and expert witnesses for the Crown in a number of claims have taken a conservative approach to its interpretation, attempting to restrict the definition of taonga to include only the kinds of things likely to have been valued by Maori in the mid-nineteenth century. Maori on the other hand assert that the Treaty upholds their authority over their taonga, period - not just those considered valuable in 184〇. A conflict has thus emerged between those who consider the TribunaFs primary task to be the reconstruction of nineteenth-century understandings through the deployment of historical and ethnographic evidence, and those for whom the Treaty is a living document, protecting the salience and ongoing development of Maori principles and values in perpetuity Those who hold the latter view have often described the Treaty itself as a taonga, a sacred covenant between Maori chiefs and the British people. As the Ngapuhi chief and scholar Sir James Henare wrote in the 1980s:
Ko oku whakaaro ake mo te Tiriti 〇 Waitangi, he taonga tapu, he mea ta ki te moko no 〇 ratou kiri. He tapu ra 〇 tatou tupuna, matauranga, he tohunga, he Ariki hoki.
Here are my thoughts about the Treaty of Waitangi. It is a sacred taonga, incised with tattoos from the skins of our ancestors. It is their tapu (sacred power), the tapu of their knowledge, of their priests and high chiefs.
(in Blank et al. 1985: 113; trans. Anne Salmond)
Henare refers here to the way in which many chiefs who 'signed5 the Treaty at Waitangi and other parts of the country in 1840 did so by inscribing designs from their moko or facial tattoos onto the parchment of the document. In Maori, the head is the most tapu part of the body, and the heads of rangatira or high-born people, intricately tattooed in a manner that brought the person's whakapapa or genealogy out onto the surface of their skin, were among the most spiritually potent objects one might encounter. In drawing their moko marks onto the Treaty, the chiefs extended their own mana to the document, rendering it an instantiation of their personhood as the 'living face5 of their line. Such practice was already commonplace in transactionsinvolving land, and there are extant deeds on which the entire moko pattern covering the face of the signatory is inscribed.
Maori and the power of writing
Even by 1840, though, there were Maori who had become familiar with the practice of writing, largely through the work of missionaries whose teachings focused upon the Bible, the sacred power of the word of God. Many copies of the Bible and other religious texts were translated into Maori then printed and circulated, and Maori who were taught to read and write in the mission schools sought to pass these skills onto others. A number of the chiefs who signed the Treaty thus wrote out their own names, committing these personal marks of another kind to this new and highly tapu taonga. This movement, from the drawing out of whakapapa onto the surface of the skin with uhi or tattooing chisels, then onto paper with pen and ink, into writing in the form of signatures, meant that for Maori (who had no indigenous script of their own), written language possessed powers with which they were familiar, as well as those with which they were not.
The same could be said for printed material. Books held a fascination right from the start, not simply as a result of missionary emphasis on the Paipera Tapu (Holy Bible). On Captain Cook's second voyage to the Pacific, for example, William Wales recorded that a copy of Tom Jones was filched by a Maori man from the ship's binnacle cupboard while they were moored at Totaranui (Queen Charlotte Sound) (Wales in Beaglehole 1969: 788-9). Later writers recorded how Maori were 'struck with wonder at hearing, as they described it, "a book speak",3 and went to any lengths to get hold of one, regardless of whether they could read. At a church service, as one early settler recorded,
Many of [the Maori] thought it highly proper that they should be armed with books. It might be an old ship's almanac, or a cast-away novel, or even a few stitched leaves of old newspapers.
(Clarke 1903: 31)
Others wore leaves from mission books rolled up and thrust through piercings in their ears, just like valued taonga such as the skins and beaks of huia birds, pieces of pounamu greenstone that had descended through several generations, or the rare white cloth made from aute (paper mulberry bark) and albatross down.
Yet, according to D.F. McKenzie,
For [Maori], the really miraculous point about writing was its portability; by annihilating distance, a letter allowed the person whowrote it to be in two places at once, his body in one, his thoughts in another.
(1985:19)
McKenzie5s analysis presumes, though, that early Maori shared assumptions about the natural separation of mind and body with Europeans. People who regarded taonga as possessing many qualities in common with people, however (to the extent that a person could be a taonga and vice-versa), would have conceived of such things rather differently Yes, letters and books annihilated distance, but not necessarily by enabling one's thoughts to go one way and one's body another. Given that the written and printed word alike were often treated as taonga, and that taonga were instantiations of personal (including ancestral) effect, perhaps the 'miracle' of text was that, as a special kind of taonga, it enabled a form of distributed personhood involving the mana, tapu and hau of the person - their ancestral efficacy and power, in other words - as well as their 'thoughts'. It is against this background that the notion of the Treaty of Waitangi as a taonga, a living document, should be understood.
Text as the instantiation of ancestral effect
When the Treaty was signed in 1840, several different versions with significantly different meanings were circulated around New Zealand; some forty-five chiefs signed the Maori version presented at Waitangi, which then travelled around the country, gathering over 500 signatures in all on various editions of the document. Thirty-nine chiefs appended their marks to an English version at Waikato Heads and Manukau, while a further version was printed by the Church Missionary Society at Paihia, one copy of which was also used to obtain signatures. In addition, five different versions in English were sent abroad, either to Sydney or London (McKenzie 1985: 33). Yet, as McKenzie warns, the fact that chiefs 'signed' the document in its various guises should not necessarily be taken as an indication of their agreement to its terms. Noting that few Maori at the time spoke English, McKenzie points out that the missionaries only taught reading and writing in Maori, so as to restrict their access to morally dangerous non- Scriptural material. (As one missionary remarked in 1842, 'having no other books to read but Scripture and productions from Scripture, [Maori] pursuits must all be of a sacred nature'.)4 McKenzie also argues that the 'presumed wide-spread, high-level literacy of the Maori in the 18308 is a chimera'(1985: 35). Pointing to the laborious way in which the seventy-nine chiefs who appear to have actually written their own names on the Treaty did so, along with other evidence, he concludes that it is unlikely any of them would have been able to read its contents well enough to satisfy grounds for written consent. Nor, as members of a culture accustomed tothe flexibilities of oral contractual negotiation, he argues, would they have appreciated the binding nature of the document in accordance with British intent.
If most of the chiefs were not able to read the Treaty, however, why did they extend their mana to this parchment or paper by inscribing it with the marks of their authority? That the document wielded considerable mana was clear; the pomp and ceremony surrounding its presentation, the exchange of gifts tor signatures, and Hobson's statement (translated by missionary Henry Williams) that, if the chiefs signed, the Queen would protect them, certainly impressed upon Maori the status of the Treaty as a thing of great power. Yet, as McKenzie argues, the fact that Maori remained a primarily oral/aural culture at this time would have suggested that, while the joining of their mana with that of Victoria through marking the parchment was a crucial step in establishing a relationship with the Queen of England, the details of how that relationship might work was up tor negotiation as usual, through discussion and debate. The manner in which the Treaty was presented supported that view, being read out in Maori by its translator Henry Williams, after which the chiefs were invited to present their own observations and concerns. Many spoke strongly against the Treaty's terms, yet then went on to sign it. The missionary William Colenso recorded this reluctance, along with his own reservations:
All being now ready tor the signing, the Native chiefs were called on in a body to come forward and sign the document. Not one, however, made any move nor seemed desirous of doing so till Mr. Busby [. . .] proposed calling them singly by their names. [. . .] [The first chief then approached the table.] At this point I, addressing myself to the Governor; said,-
[...]'May I ask Your Excellency whether it is your opinion that these Natives understand the articles of the treaty which they are now called upon to sign?'[...]
The Governor: If the Native chiefs do not know the contents of this treaty then it is no fault of mine. I have done all that I could do to make them understand the same, and I really don't know how I shall be enabled to get them to do so. They have heard the treaty read by Mr Williams.'
Mr Colenso: 'True, your Excellency [. . .] It is no easy matter, I well know, to get them to understand - fully to comprehend a document of this kind; still,I think they ought to know somewhat of it to constitute its legality. I speak under correction, your Excellency. I have spoken to some chiefs concerning it, who had no idea as to the purport of the treaty' Following this exchange, a large number of the chiefs present nevertheless signed the document, including many who had spoken vociferously against it. It seems possible that the content of the Treaty, in their eyes, took second place to its importance as a taonga through which their mana and tapu would be fused with that of other chiefs including Captain William Hobson, the proposed Katana or Governor, and Victoria, Queen of England.
Such treatment of written and printed documents as instantiations of chiefly mana was also evident in early land transactions. According to Anderson and Pickens, for example, the act of sale that conveyed title to much of the Wellington-Porirua district (now the site of New Zealand's capital city), was intended by the principal signatories 'to set the bounds of their mana over the harbour'(1996: 20) 一 what to European eyes appeared as an act of alienation was to Maori an assertion of chiefly efficacy and their ancestral ties to customary resources and land.
Taonga, personhood and exchange
So far I have explored how the Treaty of Waitangi and other written and printed documents were (and are) seen by Maori as taonga, things that, more than simply 'representing', 'signifying' or 'embodying' ancestral efficacy and power, are it in specific form. As Arapata Hakiwai has put it:
Our taonga are not just wooden objects or aesthetic heirlooms, they speak and represent our origins, our beliefs, our very foundation on which we order our lives. We believe that our taonga possess a mauri or life force and wairua, spirit, all of their own.
(in Cultural Conservation Advisory Council 1990:116)
Returning to Mauss, such taonga are also the hau of the transactions through which they were exchanged, gathering together the mana and tapu of all those involved. In this view, the Treaty remains a living document, as relevant to contemporary Maori as the ancestors whose presence endures in its fabric.
In a similar sense the Wai 262 claim, like others to the Tribunal, might also be regarded as a taonga, the concepts it invokes instantiating the personhood of ancestors 一 and the promises they exchanged, generating relationships with others - in the present. Perhaps an analogy can be made here with Catholic relics, which bring the power of a saint to a point of focus, creating a nexus and site for supplicants to gain direct and physical access to an otherwise divine personality and power. Yet such comparisons can be misleading, as they mask very different assumptions about the nature of persons and things. In order to engage more fully with the concept of taonga - the subject and (I argue) substance of the Wai 262 claim - it is necessary to briefly examine Maori conceptions of personhood - a discussion inseparable from the dynamics of ritual exchange. The alchemy of taonga
In Maori, a person's whakapapa (often glossed as genealogy), makes them the 'living face' of their ancestors, an element in a network of ties of descent and other relationships whose vitality endures in Te Ao Marama, 'the world of light' through their identity and form (Salmond 1995: 26). The Wai 262 Statement of Claim identifies whakapapa as a key organising principle within what it describes as the Maori 'world view'. As David Williams notes in a report commissioned by the Waitangi Tribunal for the claim, whakapapa 'is a great deal more than merely human genealogical tables of descent' (2001:10). Not simply a static record of lineages, it is an inherently dynamic cosmological system for reckoning degrees of similarity and difference, determining appropriate behaviour, and manipulating existing and potential relationships to achieve desired effects. Taonga have long been crucial participants in this relational scheme.
I have argued elsewhere (Henare 2005: 121-5) that the Treaty of Waitangi may be understood as a chiefly gift exchange, whereby Queen Victoria 'gifted' to the chiefs of New Zealand taonga including nga tikanga katoa rite tahi, exactly the same rights as the people of England, while acknowledging their authority over their lands, their settlements and their own taonga or treasured possessions. In return, the chiefs agreed to tuku5 to the Queen and her line forever te Kawanatanga katoa 〇 〇 ratou wenua, the governorship of their lands, and te hokonga 〇 era wahi wenua, the right to control the sale of land in New Zealand. Such occasions, whereby treasured taonga were exchanged in order to establish and maintain intra- or inter-tribal relationships, were already long established among Maori, and have ever since been a central feature of Maori life. They formed alliances between warring tribes, established new ties between strangers, and revitalised relationships that had gone cold. The kinds of taonga exchanged could include women and children, rights to land and resources, ancient weapons and greenstone valuables. Usually, however, taonga were passed down within kin groups, acting as (often tangible) instantiations of relationships extending across multiple generations. As Salmond has noted, such things played (and continue to play) a crucial role in bringing to a focus ancestral presence and effect:
The alchemy of taonga [brings] about a fusion of men and ancestors and a collapse of distance in space-time. [. . .] the power of [such things can] give men absolute access to their ancestors.
(1984:120)
Writing of recent experiences among his own kin group, Paul Tapsell similarly notes how:
The performance of taonga by elders effectively collapses time and reanimates the kin group's ancestral landscape, allowing descendantsto re-live the events of past generations. [. . .] This ability to collapse time, which becomes most apparent during tangihanga (death rituals, which normally extend over several days), allows ancestors and descendants to be fused back into a powerful, single genealogical identity.
(1997: 330).
Recognising the presence of whole ancestral lineages in a single taonga, as in a person, is crucial to grasping the significance of transactions in which important taonga were exchanged between kin groups to forge lasting ties across many generations. Thirteen years after the signing of the Treaty, for example, a large gathering of Maori chiefs and colonial officials congregated at a school house at Otaki north of Wellington to bid farewell to Sir George Grey, third governor of the colony, who had held this position for the past eight turbulent years of the country's early colonial period. At the gathering, as Grey recorded in his despatches to the Colonial Office, an address signed by 'all the principal chiefs of this part of the country' was presented to him, together with two ancient taonga of the Ngati Toa and Ngati Raukawa tribes. Grey conveyed a copy of the address, together with these artefacts, to the Duke of Newcastle in London, along with a detailed account of their presentation, published in the New Zealand Spectator.
At eleven A.M., several of the principal chiefs [. . .] having assembled in the new School-house, Thompson [son of the late fighting chief Te Rauparaha] proceeded to read the address on behalf of the native tribes of the southern part of New Zealand [in front of a large, mainly Maori, audience]. After which, a most interesting and affecting ceremony took place: Ranguira [sic - Rangiuira], the wife of Rangihaeta [sic - Te Rangihaeata], was led forward by several people, one of whom having cut the string by which a valuable green jasper ear-ring (a very old heir-loom of the Ngatitoa tribe) was attached to her ear, handed it first to Rangihaeata. The old chief then proceeded after the ancient Maori custom of 'Hongi' to press the green stone to his nose, and pass it over his face in token of farewell, having finally parted with the precious heir-loom of the tribe as the most expressive mode of conveying to the Governor the assurance of his regard and esteem. The same ceremony was gone through by all the other chiefs present at the delivery, and was likewise performed on a Patu Paraoa, an instrument of war, also a very old heir-loom of Taratoa's tribe.
(Correspondence'. 286-7)
The taonga that Grey was given on this occasion were indeed important valuables. Each bore its own name and had descended to the chiefs who presented them over many generations. That which was taken from the earof Te Rangiuira was called Kaitangata, 'eater of men5. The Spectator recorded that:
It was first of all supposed to have been the property of Te Ngahue, a chief who came from Hawaiki, one of the Polynesian Islands, in his canoe, and having discovered the New Zealand islands, visited Te Wai Pounamu [the South Island] where he procured this jasper stone, which he called Kaitangata.
Te Ngahue then took the greenstone back to his homeland of Hawaiki, the place from where the ancestors of the Maori people emigrated to New Zealand. The Spectator continues:
Te Ngahue never returned to New Zealand; but his people, hearing of the fame thereof, embarked in two canoes, called Tainui and Te Arawa, and brought back with them here the Greenstone. From them, as the ancestors of the Ngatitoa tribe, it has descended through several generations.
(Correspondence: 286)
The patu paraoa or whale bone handclub given to Grey at the same time was Hine Te Ao, a maternal ancestor of the Ngati Raukawa tribe. According to the Spectator:
Hine Te Ao was bom at Maungatantari [sic - Maungatautari]. She had a brother called Te Maihi, who was very nearly killed with this Patu Paraoa. It was in consequence seized and taken in payment for the offence by his sister, who gave to it her own name in remembrance of the painful event, and from her it has descended through six generations to the present time. It was presented to His Excellency by Taratoa in the name and on behalf of the chiefs and people belonging to his tribe, called Ngatiraukawa.
(Correspondence: 287)
After being passed down from generation to generation within their respective tribes, therefore, these precious and ancient taonga were presented to Grey as a representative of the British Crown, the inheritor of the promises made in the Treaty Such prestations between Maori tribes and members of the royal family and their colonial agents have indeed continued over time into the present - Queen Elizabeth II, for example, wears a kiwi feather cloak she was given by Maori people at Rotorua on all of her visits to New Zealand.
Paul Tapsell,a museum anthropologist and young leader in the Arawa tribal confederation, has explained the significance of such transactions with regard to the recent return of tribal taonga to his own kin group, the NgatiWhakaue people. In Maori, Tapsell notes, taonga are exchanged between lineages rather than individuals, and only the most valuable taonga are considered worthy of release to another kin group. The more valuable the taonga, 'the greater the prestige bestowed upon the receiver5, and the heavier the obligation tor future reciprocity (utu) (2000:15;1997: 337-8). The 'intention and result5 of such prestations, as Metge has emphasised:
was not to discharge the obligation between givers and receivers but to create and keep it moving from one party to the other, binding them in an on-going relationship. The expression 'tuia, tui, tuia5 sums up this to and fro movement, 'stitching5 the parties together.
(1992: 66)
The taonga 'gifted5 to Grey, then, like those exchanged in the Treaty, were intended to revitalise (and no doubt improve)6 relations between the chiefs (as the concentration points of their kin groups' mana) and Grey as representative of the British Crown and thus of Victoria's line. In hongi-ing the taonga, the chiefs were mingling their own hau or breath of life with that of the ancestor-object, thus binding the intertwined lineages of the chiefs and that of Grey together, re-animating the promises of the Treaty and focusing their relationship in the form of their ancestor, the ancient taonga. As Tapsell notes, however, whereas within Maoridom, 'concern about the future well-being of [such] taonga was never an issue because the recipients understood their obligations as custodians5, when a taonga was gifted into European hands, utu (the principle of equal return) was not always fulfilled. This created an imbalance which must be redressed, sometimes through the return of the taonga to the descendants of its former owners (2000:15;1997: 337-8). In the case of the taonga gifted to Grey, as with those exchanged in the Treaty, there was certainly an expectation among the Maori participants of an ongoing return. This would continue the relationship between Victoria's line and the chief's own descendants established in the Treaty, in which redress could be sought for the failure to make a sufficient return. The hau of the original gift lives on, requiring reciprocity through successive generations. This goes some way toward explaining the motivations behind the Wai 262 claim.
It is important to emphasise here that the gifting of taonga is not simply a feature of the past in New Zealand. Despite Maori being active participants in a predominantly anglophone twenty-first century society, such arrangements continue today; there are recent cases of children being 'exchanged5 between tribal groups to balance historical conflicts or transactions, and valuable taonga continue to be 'gifted5 to establish and maintain relations. The exchange of taonga in Maori has long been an integral part of the work of relating, and continues to be so in the present. Taonga and objectification
The Wai 262 claim remains unresolved, and continues to excite controversy in New Zealand. While the claim follows and appeals to the logic of Maori gift exchange, some critics argue that it is holding up long-overdue reforms of intellectual property law, and thus deterring foreign investment, while the media represents it as yet another example of Maori gaining mileage out of postcolonial political posturing.7 These arguments centre on an apparent paradox at the heart of the negotiations, which are presided over by the Waitangi Tribunal in an adversarial setting. Evidence is presented alternately by expert witnesses (many of them anthropologists) acting for the Crown, and by those working for the claimants. The stakes for winning a scholarly point are high, as the Tribunal has the power to recommend substantial financial reparations. The inferred paradox is this: if the basis of Wai 262 and other Maori claims is an appeal to tradition - the enduring salience of principles, practices and beliefs held in common with ancestors - then how can Maori claim special rights over things that are the commodified products of global capitalism? How, in other words, can they participate simultaneously in what appear as two distinct - even antithetical-cultural perspectives, one distinctively Maori, the other quintessentially Western?
It is not only those averse to postcolonial reparations who experience this as a contradiction. Anthropologists and historians, among them a number of Maori scholars, also struggle to reconcile the dynamism and vitality of Maori culture with assertions that a distinctively 'Maori world view5, the parameters of which were laid down long before the arrival of European colonists, prevails among Maori in present-day New Zealand. Some attempt to resolve this through theories of strategic essentialism and neo-traditional- isation, sympathetically crafting commensurability out of political expedience and instrumentality (e.g. Hanson 1989; Levine 1991; Neich 1978; 1983; Sissons 1993;1998). Others are more cynical, accusing the Tribunal of manufacturing history for present purposes (Oliver 2001),or charging some Maori and their supporters with cultural fundamentalism (e.g. Rata 2005). There is a common thread to all these stories, one which, I will argue, concerns objectification.
All the things that are claimed in Wai 262, including genetic resources, are claimed as taonga, a concept which, as already noted, is often glossed as 'treasured ancestral possessions5, but which, I will suggest, may be understood here as particular kinds of objectifications - in Strathem5s sense, as 'persons and things [. . .] construed as having value5 (1988:176). I am using the term 'objectification5 advisedly here, building on Strathem5s work and that of James Leach (2003a; 2003b), to describe a process that, while producing objects of a kind, does not necessarily invoke a subject (or at least the sort of subject that generally springs to Euro-American minds). Objectifications in the form of taonga are inherently productive, and reproductive, as they botharise from and are generative of relations. As distributed parts of persons, and as persons in their own right, taonga 一 whether in the form of people, knowledge, carved objects, the Maori language and even the radio spectrum - are a fundamental requirement of relationality This is not to say that they give form and substance to something that would otherwise remain abstract, floating around in some sort of nebulous social ether, nor simply, to paraphrase Alfred Gell, that relations are a characteristic of the substantive world of people and things in which we live, rather than merely an attribute of an abstracted human sociality It is that the very partibility and motility of taonga (see Holbraad, Chapter 9 of this volume), their,thinginess' within a general state of flux, is precisely what makes them indispensable to the work of relating. Perhaps somewhat unlike the Melanesianists, therefore, I am using the term 'objectification' because I wish to emphasise the objectlike qualities of taonga over their relational capacities, which is something I take as given.
This is no doubt a risky strategy, making it potentially harder rather than easier to convey the point, as it might be confused with certain arguments about the 'invention' of culture and tradition. Perhaps the thing to emphasise here is that the creativity in Maori modes of objectification is not a property peculiar to human beings. Taonga are not simply artefacts of individual subjectivity, nor of human agency in general; they are at once the product and fabric of dynamic relational matrices involving all manner of entities, that shift and transform over time. Foregrounding taonga as objects is neither a simple index of Westernisation, nor just a convenient analytic conceit. It is a way of approaching a concept that is not translatable in terms available to anglophone law or anthropology, a juxtaposition intended to throw into relief certain aspects of taonga that otherwise would be impossible to convey
Objectification, anthropocentrism, and analyses of cultural change
Yet it is a commonplace in analyses of socio-cultural change, particularly those dealing with 'fourth world' societies or former colonies, that objectification -of one's self or one's culture - is a practice with a distinctively Euro-American pedigree. A side-effect of rejecting earlier anthropological tendencies that allegedly arrested 'primitive' cultures in an eternal ethnographic present (but cf Sahlins 1999: 404-5), and of the resultant emphasis on the processual dynamism of culture, is that any effort to delineate and demarcate elements of culture, to reflect upon it, or foreground its continuities, is regarded as derivative of that earlier way of thinking. It is of course ironic (or perhaps something more sinister) that such a view has become endemic in the social sciences and humanities just as various minority groups, among them indigenous peoples, are attempting to assert their cultural distinctiveness on a world stage, often by appearing to deploy suchstrategies. (Whatever pronouncements they make on their own account, as Adam Kuper has recently argued, 'they do so in the idiom of Western culture theory5 (2003: 395).) But I am more interested here in the theoretical implications of this kind of analysis, which seems to involve a degree of ontological projection.
The argument that peoples such as Maori are simply borrowing from the conceptual toolbox of anthropology (or of the West in general) tor the sake (however laudable) of self determination obscures another possibility - that they are using the language of social theory in an attempt to articulate (untranslatable) concepts of their own. One reason why scholars might find it difficult to take their pronouncements seriously is not simply that the terminology deployed can appear somewhat dated - the often-used 'Maori world view5 springs to mind - but that we are unwilling to acknowledge even the potential alterity of what is being put forward. As earlier mentioned, there is an idea about that incorporation into global capitalism and modernity involves a net conceptual loss on the part of the less powerful, resulting in a tragic though inevitable decline into inauthenticity, a kind of conceptual miscegenation. In this sense the very act of incorporating people into the anthropos - the 'family of mankind5 -long regarded as the philosophical baseline of anthropology, entails deploying a set of assumptions built on specific notions of relatedness. Notwithstanding that such ideas have been thoroughly unpacked in 'the new kinship studies5, or that terms such as 'race5 have been largely rejected (at least in the academy), a residual biolo- gism remains evident at the heart of contemporary anthropology. Assertions of a shared humanity are often based on the assumption of a universal (linguistically capable and reproductively isolated) subjectivity. (Among the most enduring elements in this scheme is of course the distinction between animate, agentive subjects and an inert and malleable materiality.) There are very good reasons tor insisting on the authority of this conception, connected historically to the abolition of slavery, the rights of women and other moral and political imperatives. In insisting on an ontological apartheid between persons and things, however, it comes with a degree of hubris about the power and efficacy of some conceptions over others, a sort of philosophical 'survival of the fittest5. The strength of such moral convictions undermines analytic flexibility, preventing us from taking seriously other peoples' accounts of reality What if, as I am arguing, there were other processes we might recognise as objectification in a certain sense? And what if such processes derived from quite different (and enduring) ontological assumptions?
I	have argued that the taonga claimed in Wai 262, rather than being simply an example of the creative appropriation by Maori of European notions of property and ownership, are in fact distinctively Maori kinds of objects with a creativity of their own. Whereas it is common to juxtapose indigenous conceptions of property with those of the West in order to emphasise the fluid, relational character of the former in contrast to thealienating, divisive nature of the latter, however, I am interested in why Maori might wish to highlight what I am calling the object-like qualities of taonga, the ways in which they are relevant to questions of ownership in a legal sense. This is not because I want to obscure the relational capacities of taonga - the ways in which they are valued tor their capacity to generate relationships, which, as Leach (2003a) has recently argued (drawing on the work of Paul Tapsell) is fundamental to their operations. It is because the very different concepts of taonga and property have been brought together into a single sphere, in which one encompasses the other, in the Wai 262 'cultural property5 claim.
Deploying the taonga-status of the Treaty as a 'living document5, an instantiation of ancestral efficacy, the claim interweaves Maori concepts with strands of legal discourse, in a pattern laid down many years ago. (New Zealand statutes have incorporated Maori terminology since at least 1955.) Rather than simply deploying the idiom of Western culture theory, therefore, as Kuper and others would have it, Maori are not only insisting upon but demonstrating the persistent salience and enduring vitality of their own concepts, and, by extension, of distinctively Maori ways of being.
It thus seems that, instead of working from within a single perspective, Maori are shifting between registers of value in a move enabled by the encompassment of one - that of commodities - by the other - that of taonga. This commensurability is consistent with Maori notions of relatedness, in that, according to the workings of whakapapa, Maoriness encompasses other identities without obliterating or diluting them - one may be Maori and Irish, but even a majority Irish ancestry does not make one any less Maori. rFhe implications of this for analyses of cultural dynamism and the articulation of culture-based claims in postcolonial situations are significant and wide-ranging. If one can no longer assume that the effects of colonisation necessarily adulterate or demolish distinctive concepts, producing ontological hybrids, half-castes and cross-breeds, then it is necessary to acknowledge positions that may be wholly Maori and also European. The creativity of taonga does not derive simply from the minds of individual subjects, but from a fabric of relations peopled both by objects that appear as people, and by people that appear as things.

THE 'LEGAL THING' IN
SWAZILAND
Res judicata and divine kingship
Sari Wastell
This contribution endeavours to push the proposed methodology of the present volume to something of an extreme. If the remit of this collection has been to suggest the ways in which a methodological attentiveness to 'things' can expose the outlines of disparate ontologies 一 formulations of the nature of reality where presumed divisions between subjects and objects, persons and things emerge from ethnography rather than precede ethnographic description - then the object of this chapter's attentions seems counter-intuitive. Law, and here very specifically the received law of the Kingdom of Swaziland (which is to say the rule of law system inherited from the country's colonial era), is often imagined as the most heady of abstractions, a monolith of analogies and formalism which the legal realists ridiculed as 'transcendental nonsense' (Cohen 1935; 1960, passim). Even where legal theorists advocated a return to empirical studies of law, verifiable concepts, and (legal) knowledge as experience linked to problem-solving (all hallmarks of the realist schools of jurisprudence), law itself was never couched in terms of a 'thing'. Indeed, where law equated quite strictly to the aggregate of rules which comprised a given legal system, the rules had to be administered and interpreted in order to earn the title of law; 'paper' rules remain ephemeral and count as law only once meaning is added through judicial interpretation. And the counterparts of these 'rule-sceptics' were the 'fact-sceptics', whose concern for the inherent uncertainty in law turned on the multiple meanings and interpretations which could attach to legal facts - a position which only further separated the immaterial character of law from the observable behaviours which animated it. In short, 'realism' in jurisprudence conferred no greater substantiality to an entity known as 'law', it merely re-focused attention onto those social interactions which concretised legal abstraction. And in such formulations, one can see the very meaning/ thing divide which this volume has sought to reject.
That is not to say that there are no precedents within jurisprudence for addressing the 'thing-like' nature of law - i.e. res judicata) In fact, one recent article by Lior Barshack (2000) will set the stage for much of theproceeding discussion. However; within anthropology, there has been a long tradition of treating the instantiations of legal, political and/or cosmological authority through law as visible expressions of hidden forces (although note that Riles, discussed later in this essay, sees this trend reversing (2003)). It is probable that the idea that law instantiated or articulated powers or forces external to itself was shored up from two directions - studies of Western rule of law systems which sought to understand whether law was a part of society or somehow an external reflection of it2 on the one hand, and studies of customary legal systems (especially those of Africa) where the divine or charismatic authority that legitimates law is often transcendental in character and hidden from view in a variety of ways in legal proceedings3 on the other. In both instances, law could only ever appear as a conduit for something else - its meanings always being sought from somewhere outside the law itself However; the task of this essay is to work ethnographically from the practice of 'Western5 law in an African country, bearing in mind those discussions within jurisprudence which seek to distinguish between law-as- activity (specifically, a normative activity) and law-as-thing (res judicata). What I will argue is that in some contexts, received law in Swaziland is approached not solely - in some instances perhaps not even primarily - as an activity centred on logic, rationale and argument through which meanings can attach to events brought before the law. Rather, the 'legal thing5 in Swaziland is, at times, an entity through which an alternative formulation of power and efficacy is presenced, such that the law (in this case received law), emerges as a meaning-artefact, an entity whose very opacity, but simultaneously magical presence, makes it an amenable thing through which Swazis can both think and act.
What is striking when one begins to study law in Swaziland is the seeming contradiction between two thoroughly entrenched presuppositions. On the one hand, most Swazis will repeatedly assure you that one cannot expect justice from the magistrate's courts and high court which comprise the received law system. Criminals will always be let off, stolen goods will never be returned, and victimhood will always be translated into the peripheral role of a witness for the prosecution of a crime made against the state.4 Whenever I spoke with a friend or neighbour who had been the victim of a theft or the like, the preferred recourse was to Swazi law and custom (the so- called 'customary law5) or even to informal policing bodies such as the community police or local, hired security guards. A Swazi court president, a chief or your local security guard was best positioned to help you - they knew who the 'bad guys' were in the community and they had little truck for allowing lawyers to act out their perversions of justice in the name of a presumption of innocence. Most people with whom I spoke, some lawyers included, acknowledged the greater speed and efficiency with which Swazi law and custom dispensed justice. (And here it is important to note that the conciliatory strategies or restitutive measures enacted by community policeand security guards were understood to be an extension of the workings of Swazi law and custom.) Western courts 一 as they are sometimes referred to in Swaziland - were seen to fail on every count.
Yet the contradiction is this. Swaziland is profoundly litigious - a place where the suspension of the rule of law in 2001 tor a period of nearly three years was not viewed as an impediment to the lawyers5 trade because, as one informant put it, 'Swazis will always want to drag things into court5 (and here again, it was received courts specifically to which he was referring). I pressed several colleagues on this point. With some court decisions taken up to three years ago not being honoured because they displeased the king, would not legal activity diminish? Would people not eschew the considerable cost of bringing a case to court in light of the fact that they could not be certain a decision taken there would be honoured anyway? Many of my lawyer friends seemed nonplussed, and indeed, anecdotally at least, courtroom activity seems to have thrived between 2001 and 2004. In fact, even challenges to the suspension of the rule of law were played out in a variety of ways within the courtroom.
During my most recent stay in the country in the autumn of 2004 the debate around the legality of the Macetjeni and Kamkhweli evictions (deriving from a longstanding chieftaincy dispute) came to a head when the government rescinded the 28 November 2001 statement, which had suspended the rule of law, and invited the evictees back onto their lands. Upon returning however, the evictees were turned away repeatedly by the police, despite the fact that Prince David, the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs, confirmed that they had been free to return to their homes from 17 September 2004 onwards. The matter took on a particular urgency due to the fact that the Court of Appeal,a bench of judges drawn from Swaziland, South Africa and Botswana and representing the final level of appeal within the received law system of Swaziland, had just arrived back in Swaziland to sit tor the first time since they disbanded in protest at the suspension of the rule of law in 2001. Assured that the decision by their court to return the evictees to their lands had finally been recognised, they had agreed to return, only to discover that the evictees had been driven from their homes after each attempt to re-settle. In an effort to apprise the returning Court of Appeal judges of the 'real' situation with respect to the rule of law in Swaziland, attorney Ben Simelane submitted an affidavit to the Registrar of the Court of Appeal on 15 November 2004 explaining the ongoing persecution his clients had faced throughout the autumn of 2004.
The affidavit looks much like many others I have come across. A cover page is followed by the point-by-point assertions of the deponent and is concluded by a notarisation by a commissioner of oaths. Each page is affixed with a 2 emalengani stamp (the local currency), and the filing notice clearly states the full address of the attorney who is presenting in the matter. The one curiosity of the document, however, is its deviation from form atthe very top of the cover page. For affidavits are always filed with reference to a specific matter. For this reason, there is a space at the top to fill in which reads: CASE NO [. . .] /04. On the Simelane affidavit of 15 November 2004, this space is left blank. And where it continues 'In the matter between:5, the author has simply inserted 'MACETJENI/KAMKHWELI EVICTION5. The point is, this affidavit does not actually pertain to any pending court matter. It is a completely redundant document. Where a court order has not been executed, one applies to the court to find whoever is obstructing the enacting of the court's decision in contempt and to issue a warrant of arrest. One does not go back to court to open a case about why the court's earlier decision has not been recognised. One can appeal against a decision; it is a nonsense to appeal in favour of one! But here we have an affidavit -like a protest made under oath - tor submission to a court which is presently not sitting on any related matter.
My point in raising this example is simple. Clearly, given the cost of taking a matter to the received courts, most Swazis would only ever find themselves in such a court by means of a summons. So when I say Swazis are litigious, I must be referring in the first instance to a minority elite who can afford to pursue their concerns via court actions. And amongst even relatively affluent Swazis, I have innumerable examples of this - from low- waged waitresses suing for constructive dismissal with little illusion that their matter will be heard equitably, to well-heeled businessmen who keep their lawyers5 numbers on their speed-dial so they can raise libel actions, a reflex which is popularly acknowledged as underscoring the actual 'truth5 of the libellous statement (a point not lost on those who still choose to sue). When sitting in any of my favourite watering-holes in Mbabane, the capital- usually flanked by several lawyers unwinding after a long day of courtroom appearances and client meetings - one could be forgiven for mistaking litigation for a national passtime. The mobile phones around the table ring in a syncopated concert, abrupt consultations end with precise instructions to clerks to draft up documents overnight, and urgent applications follow in the morning. A disproportionate amount of discussion and speculation surrounds accusations made in the daily paper which might give rise to court action, and even seemingly trivial affairs are first contemplated in terms of court proceedings, when a simple phone call or small measure of compromise might actually suffice.
However, my larger point is that even those Swazis who are excluded from this frenzy of ongoing courtroom intrigue, exhibit a fascination for the (received) law. While most criminal and civil matters are dealt with through Swazi law and custom for the vast majority of Swazis, certain kinds of issues are played out almost exclusively in the various fora of the received law. And the type of case which will concern us here always turns on political debate around the contest between 'traditional5 and 'modem5 forms of authority and governance. The Macetjeni/Kamkhweli affidavit was a case in point.There were any number of places where the failure of His Majesty's Government (very specifically at His Majesty's request) to abide by a court decision might have been voiced: the royal kraal, the parliamentary proceedings in Lobamba, the toyi-toyi protests of the labour unions taking place in the streets of Mbabane and in front of various government ministries. But an affidavit, a meticulously constructed narrative of the tribulations of two of the evictees,5 was presented to the court - even in the absence of a case to which it might lend support. Such is the allure of the courtroom in Swaziland. Even where the power of the courts to enforce their decisions is rendered impotent, the received law court remains the arena par excellence for the negotiation of certain types of claims. Its effect appears almost mystical (although I will later come to argue that these engagements with the law are entirely pragmatic in nature).
While most Swazis will never have personal experience of these institutions, received law courts still remain the appropriate site in which to make certain kinds of challenges. So, for example, when violence and protests erupt on the streets over unilateral decisions taken 'by the monarchy, the nation's eyes will inevitably turn to see what the courts have to say on the given matter. The import of the Simelane affidavit was precisely that it was not meant to persuade the judges to decide a particular matter in a certain way The matter was far too broad to be held within the scope of a single court action, and the judges were not the exclusive addressees to whom the document offered testimony. Indeed, they were only a part of the affidavit's intended audience - in fact a synecdoche for the real audience - the Swazi people. And more importantly, the document was both less and more than the narrative contained within its pages.
What I shall argue is that the Simelane affidavit indexes the extent to which Swazis reify ('Western') law as a particular kind of encompassing phenomenon - a phenomenon of a type with the divine kingship which organises Swazi sociality more generally. The law is approached as a civic totem of Western power (to borrow Barshak's phrase), where power is understood to be neither abstract nor a quality to be held, wielded or mobilised by a more concrete entity (see also Holbraad, Chapter 9 in this volume). One way to understand this conceptualisation of power6 would be to see it as a direct corollary of how sovereignty is imagined and refracted through the prism of divine kingship in Swaziland, where the entirety of the Swazi nation is one in the person and body of the king. As such, 'subjects'7 of His Majesty are not in a relationship of obedience to him, but part of the essence or enduring substance of kingship itself, a substance which is 'generative force' rather than exercises it Thus, when Swazis engage with the civic totem that is 'Western' law, it is an alternative, non-Swazi form of this 'force' that Swazis understand as being presenced in the legal object.8
However, to pursue such an imagining of law-as-object, we need to begin closer to home. That is to say, it is first important to understand the ways inwhich scholars have already begun to think about the law as a unitary 'thing', largely in reaction to decades of scholarship which insisted on the fragmentary and intangible nature of the law. My difficulty with this new trend is a wholly anthropological one. In conceiving of the law as an object, what remains unexamined is what actually constitutes an object in the first place. Through a detailed examination of Annelise Riles' recent work Taw as object' (2003), I hope to undermine not the conceptualisation of law as an object, but the presumed universality of 'objects' which might remain unenunciated in such an argument. Tacking between Riles' exploration of law in relation to Fijian identity politics and land claims in the colonial and postcolonial eras and my own work on kingship, law and sovereignty in Swaziland, I hope to demonstrate how disparate conceptualisations of sovereignty (if sovereignty is indeed the right word - see conclusion below) evoke distinct imaginings of the kind of object law might be.
Law as tool, law as a presenced essence
Already I am aware that there might be a great deal of unease in referring to such a thing as 'the law', as if such an entity self-evidently existed. As Annelise Riles so aptly noted, a lawyer (and Swazi lawyers account for many of the informants whose insights inform my rendering of received law in this chapter) would not recognise in their own engagements an 'interlocutor' which they could map onto my reified invocation of 'the law':
Lawyers view their world as consisting of various phenomena and stances - rights discourse, constitutions, procedures, bureaucracies, doctrines, private norms, and dispute settlement processes. There is no impetus to put these together into a single actant, 'the Law', whose consequences can be evaluated as a whole.
(2003:190)
And certainly within jurisprudence and socio-legal studies, the reification of 'the law' is now held to be an error of past generations, not wholly unlike anthropology's great misgivings about our antecedents who once reified 'culture'. However, my argument here would 'be that in the Swazi context, the objectification of the law in this way is not a sleight of hand on the part of the anthropologist, but an artefact of the popular imagination.9 rFhis would contrast with Riles' discussion of 'law as object', insofar as her account, while compassing many of the same ends, explores the motivations and ramifications of anthropology's reification of 'the law'. Nonetheless, Riles' distinction between what she terms the 'expressive' and 'instrumental' genres of law exhibits both common denominators and some very salient differences with the practices I will be describing for Swaziland, and thus demands an abbreviated excursus. Riles begins and ends her discussion of 'law as object5 with an important observation about the uncomfortable parallels between law's capacity to create significations and anthropology's efforts to do the same. If at one point it was particularly fashionable to deconstruct the objectifications made by colonial law, the self-realisation that anthropology's own objectifications held too much in common with colonial legal practices was always in the offing. 1b put it rather bluntly, the presumption of an external subject position from which to create objects of knowledge - together with the concomitant presumption that the meanings and inter-relations of those objects were dissociable and required re-connection by law and/or anthropology 一 was a common ground which would ultimately turn anthropology's critique of law into auto-critique. Hence both anthropology's initial interest in law and its subsequent desuetude.10
However, this sense of law - a law which is exterior to the society over which it arbitrates 一 is only one of the two modalities of law Riles seeks to investigate.11 She suggests that this 'expressive genre' of law captured anthropological attention up until the discipline's late-twentieth-century 'exhaustion with denomination and identification' (ibid.:188), not least because it correlated to the discipline's (Foucauldian-inspired) preoccupation with those forms of knowledge generated by the colonial endeavour and its objectifications of the colonised (not to mention the ways in which such objectifications cycled back into colonial and indigenous knowledge practices alike). Here law, like anthropology, was predicated on meaningcreation. In colonial contexts, law-making was intimately tied to the delineating of social groups - in Riles' ethnography, Europeans from native Fijians, although her primary concern is with the so-called 'half-castes' who confounded a world so-ordered. Again, like anthropology, law in this expressive genre proves a reflexive entity, at once standing apart from the world and designating the relations between the various parts that comprise the whole (e.g. one law applies to the Europeans, another to the Fijians, thus not only distinguishing the two but also defining the nature of the relation of each group to the other) even as it draws attention to its own distinctiveness from that whole - rendered visible in its very ability to create such effects. Put another way, it is the very externality of 'the world' to 'the law' that allows for law-making. So it follows that law, in this expressive genre, not only objectifies social groups (among other things), but also the very act of law-making through which those social groups are constituted. Importantly, law working in this expressive genre becomes a site of contention - a place where significations outlive their utility or cease to map onto the objects of contemplation - a place, in short, in constant need of reinterpretation. If, to take Riles' example, property relations are objectifications created by law in its expressive form, these objectifications are fragile insofar as they can fall out of sync with historical and political contexts. However, Riles contends that this genre of law is complemented by another - the instrumental genre - which has overtaken the expressive genre in gamering anthropology's attentions at the turn of the century. A primary difference between the two is the extent to which the latter is marked by a vacuity of meaning. Unlike the expressive genre, where law stands apart from the world and relates elements in that world through meaning-creation, law in its instrumental guise, is an object in its own right - an artefact in the world. Riles compares the two genres by contrasting how land features in each: where the expressive genre creates objectifications about property relations (connecting people to land, as disparate elements in the world, through idioms of ownership), the instrumental genre creates the object that is the land registration document. As she notes with respect to such documents, 'The instrumental genre fades into its target: Land registration documents, diagrams, and records become instantiations, not mere representations, of property rights' (ibid.: 204, emphasis mine). In the terms contemplated within this volume, land registration documents betray an indissolubility of meaning and artefact, insofar as there is nothing beneath the surface of the document, no latent meaning to be excavated and re-attached to the document -no idea or formulation about the world to be diagnosed from the formal aesthetics which characterise the document's construction. Rather the land registration form, like law in its instrumental form more generally, is a tool in the world which can be mobilised to a variety of ends. And as Riles concludes, 'To take the law as object in this sense is not to "know" law but to work through law' (ibid.: 209), an impulse which Riles feels characterises anthropology's engagement with law in the present moment.
So in this exploration of the instrumental genre of law, Riles has gone some considerable way towards restoring a sense of 'thinginess' to the law. In its instrumental mode, law is a 'thing' by negative definition. It is not abstract, not an idea about the world, but rather a 'tool'-her word - in the world through which to achieve a range of outcomes. And in all of this, one can hear many resonances with the general timbre of this contribution and its animus to breach the meaning-thing divide. But I might flag the implications of that word 'tool'. For in suggesting that these two genres create different forms of reifications such that 'legal knowledge is alternatively in the world and a reflection of it, alternatively knowledge and its own object' (ibid.: 206), one finds an ethnographic specificity to the practices she is describing.
In this geminate model of law, characterised by sequenced genres, law emerges as a technology, a contrivance, at once ideal and concrete, and due to its Janus-like character, a practicable instrument through which to effect the agendas of agents outside itself Its reification confers a certain materiality -in the expressive mode \a^-making is objectified to the exclusion of the law and in the instrumental mode the two are conflated into a unitary object 一 but its force and potentialities must be directed and manipulatedfrom outside of itself But most of all, it emerges as a very finite medium - 'finite' because it is limited in magnitude, and 'medium' because it serves as an intervening substance through which to realise ends not intrinsic to the substance itself And therein lies the ethnographic specificity - a modernist predilection tor confining phenomena in the world to a subsidiary position vis-a-vis the world. What I want to explore is a context where the law is not a thing in the world, but a materialisation of the world itself
So while I seize upon Riles' exposition in order to shift attention from a relentlessly abstract and conceptual sense of the law (the expressive genre) towards a more substantive and object-like understanding, I would be quick to point out at this juncture that 'things' themselves take on a variety of disparate forms. And the thing-like nature of received law in Swaziland is, if you will,a very different thing altogether. Let me sketch out some of the failures of correspondence with recourse to ethnography
In Riles' discussion of the title documents produced by the process of land registration, she explored the extent to which the ordinances governing such matters concerned themselves with the minutiae of aesthetic forms. This preoccupation with the detail of how the titles are actually constructed had it own effects: 'These formalities drew the grantor and the grantee into a set of actions distinguishable in genre from others and expressly marked as distinctive in this way' (ibid.: 202). Thus, the object created by the instrumental genre of law is marked out as especially 'legal', operating at a register informed by a plethora of other social practices and relationships (ibid.: 203), but still held up as discrete by the formal features it engendered. rFhis in turn activated a distinctive temporal idiom, one which collapsed the past into the present of the title document, eclipsing the multifaceted relations which were, inevitably, the document's precursors.
In Swaziland, aesthetic form is no less of a concern than in Fiji, but I suggest that its effects are geared in a different direction. As I mentioned before, the received law courts are widely mistrusted by the general public, and one of the most oft-cited reasons for this is that they are 'foreign' in nature. Like the bicameral parliament of the country, the workings of the court are not only recognised as part of the country's colonial inheritance, but their 'Western' character is the subject of considerable comment.
In both fora, the English language predominates. In the courts, it is the only language spoken. This might not seem odd altogether (and indeed simultaneous translation is available in the sittings of both the Senate and the House as debate moves in and out of siSwati as well as English), except that many in parliament simply cannot speak English at all, and the (received law) courts in Swaziland are probably the only place where siSwati is proscribed. But the language is only one facet of a supererogatory Englishness. The wigs and robes which characterise both parliament and the high court, the arcane language and formal gestures, the overmeasure of reserve and awe accorded the bench and the speaker of the house alike, areall not out of keeping with courts in many parts of the Commonwealth. And sufficient ink has already been spent explaining the purpose of the theatre and ritual of court proceedings elsewhere to rehearse those arguments here. Rather, I want to consider what might be unique to the Swazi context in this respect.
For what does appear different is the self-conscious efforts made to underscore these attributes as expressly non-Swazi. In particular, this is effected through evidencing the counter-position - that of kingly loyalty and what the Swazis refer to as 'the Swazi Way' (kuphilisana kahle singanyatse- lani -literally, living well and not treading on one another, invoked precisely because of the mantra's dissonance with the adversarial nature of the received courts and parliamentary procedures).12 Women in particular, are called upon to 'presence' kingly respect; their heads must be covered at all times in parliament as in the courts, an act which, like placing one's left hand underneath the right forearm when shaking hands or receiving anything from the hands of another person, is understood to signal that the person in question is one in the body and person of the king - and hence, a Swazi.13 The interesting point about the injunction to wear headscarves in parliament and in court, however, is that it was explained to me as compulsory precisely because these institutions are not 'traditional' fora of law and governance. Rather, they exist at the king's pleasure, and as the monarchy would have it, within the all-encompassing purview of his divine remit. Like all of my female colleagues, I too kept a headscarf in my handbag and a long skirt in my desk drawer (no trousers allowed either) in case I was unexpectedly called to hear a case put forward on urgent application. In point of fact, the guards checking those who would hope to enter the gallery would probably not require me to fashion a makeshift headscarf from toilet paper as a colleague was once required to do, but this was explicitly justified by the fact that I was not Swazi. Indeed, many a guard was slightly confounded and more than a bit amused by my insistence on wearing the headscarf and long skirt my colleagues were required to don, a point my friends put down to the fact that I was not playing the part expected of me.
Now, elsewhere I have considered at some length the variety of paradoxes inherent in the allegedly 'dual' legal system in Swaziland - a place where all judicial, as well as executive and legislative, authority is vested in His Majesty the King. The system is deemed to be dual in the sense that there exist two parallel legal codes, the received law, based on a Roman-Dutch common law tradition, and the 'customary' law, Swazi law and custom, each of which is administered in physically disparate spaces and through a distinct cadre of personnel.14 One of the primary conundrums for me was the fact that there existed a law (within the received law system), which actually stated that the king was above the law.15 Even before considering the place of the king in both the sensibilities and practices of most Swazi subjects, the very fact that the king can pass legislation of his own accord,that legislation generated from within parliament requires his assent to become law, that he appoints all high court judges personally, that he can dissolve the high court and parliament at will, and that he cannot be summoned to court or prosecuted by any court in the country, all suggested that a law declaring his supra-legal status would be redundant.
However, jurisprudentially, the law makes sense, when considered from the perspective of Swazi law and custom (hereafter SLC). Although SLC operates with little concern tor its alleged circumscription within the received law (as spelled out in statute), and despite the fact that the popular understanding amongst most Swazis of the relation of SLC to received law is that the former trumps and encompasses the authority of the latter, received law is perceived as incommensurably 'other' in one respect. Its source - the very force of the law - does not emanate from His Majesty, as would be the case with SLC. And it is this sense of an alternative basis of power and efficacy, not simply a different way of achieving similar ends, which both necessitates the containment of the received law, but also proves it a dynamic arena for political improvisation on the part of the monarchy.
The reasons for this are complex and can only be adumbrated here, but involve the ways in which Swazi kingship is constituted through interactions with forms of power and potency which are deemed to be non-Swazi (Wiastell forthcoming). Across the body of the nation, various classes of person have some capacity to negotiate that which is non-Swazi. But these abilities are a matter of gradation16 and to the extent that a person exhibits such a faculty, the ability is understood to stem from one's relationship to His Majesty, in whom the well-being of the nation is physically embodied. In general, however, to be Swazi is to be consolidated inwards, towards the siyanqaba or fortress that is the Swazi nation-in-kingship. Only His Majesty is thought to have the exceptional capacity to breach the boundary of that fortress identity and engage fully with all that is non-Swazi. Indeed, it is in his ability to move outside of the limits of the Swazi way that his cosmological remit is made visible.
It is for this reason that the received law, whose force and legitimacy are clearly understood to derive from outside the Swazi nation, provides an arena for kingly engagements with non-Swazi forms of power. And in this sense, the law here is not a tool or something to be worked through at all. The better analogy, I would suggest, would be with sorcery (cf Kapferer 1997), where a world is presenced, and the dissensions contained within that world are confronted and addressed.
Certainly the analogy with sorcery would not prove wholly counter-intuitive were one talking about SLC, where the work of diviners (tangoma or tinyangd) are intrinsic to much legal process in the family council (ludsendvd) and chiefs' courts alike (cf Booth 1992). However, the sorts of technologies at work in those contexts proves a misleading correspondence. In fact, the occult practices associated with law (umsetfb, which can refer to both thereceived law and SLC) are akin to tools. For example, where one employs a sangoma to smell out a witch or to produce muthi which will cause a judge or chief to decide a case in one's favour, one is relying on the specialist knowledge which allows a sangoma to activate the agencies inherent in all things - animate or otherwise - in the world. This is a well established form of 'witchcraft' throughout southern Africa, and many anthropologists have explored its novel applications in contemporary circumstances (cf Ashfbrth 2005; Moore and Sanders 2001).
However, the occult practices which better approximate my intended analogy with sorcery are those which involve the embodiment and manifestation of the world itself One such example in Swaziland would be the umdvutjulwa or black bull which is integral to one of the most sacred rites of the iNcwala, or first fruits ceremony of the Swazis.17 This annual celebration is a cleansing ceremony of kingship, intended to fortify and renew His Majesty for the coming year, and in so doing, ensure the health and wellbeing of the Swazi nation. During the ritual known as kubamba inkunzi, or literally holding/grabbing the bull, regiments of young warriors are called upon to catch a black bull and kill it with their bare hands. The bull has been doctored it is said, such that when it is released into the enclosure and sees the king, it will attack him in a frenzy and kill him if the regiments do not intervene - for what the 'bull is seeing is himself Unlike the animation of an agency innate within the creature, kubamba inkunzi is a process of presenting the forces of Swazi kingship through the form of the black bull. In other words, it is an act of reification, insofar as 'kingship' is made material in the ill-fated 'beast. But just as the king is both a person and the encompassing nation that is held together within Swazi kingship (cf Kantorowicz 1997), so too the bull takes on the full and immeasurable proportions of a world constituted through kingship's potentially infinite purview. Put another way, to presence the essence of what it is to be Swazi requires a medium as limitless as kingship itself And this returns us to the distinction I made earlier between 'tools' as finite media manipulated by extrinsic forces versus the sort of 'modalities for presenting', which I would claim better correlate to Swazi engagements with the received law. The black'bull, like the received law, is neither a thing in the world through which one can act nor a representation of the world. Rather, as Bruce Kapferer contends with respect to the practices of sorcerers more generally, both 'are not analogies to the world but materialisations of its dimensions and processes, and they are conceived of as being fully vital in the reality of human experience'(1997:14).
However, it is important to remember that the analogy to sorcery is entirely my own; Swazis themselves do not speak of their engagements with the received law in idioms which would map onto their understandings of occult practices. In fact, when I essayed the comparison with the partner of an Mbabane law firm, he was mildly sceptical about the mileage I could hope to extract from the association of the two practices. What he said wastelling and spurred much of the present work forward. He conceded that in some ways, lawyers could be equated with tangoma in the sense that they both have specialist knowledge to which only very few select members of Swazi society might have access. Equally, these abilities were morally freighted; the knowledge in question could be used for beneficial or nefarious purposes - the diviner/healer manipulates the same powerful technologies as the witch - so people's view of lawyers and tangoma alike is often ambiguous and hedged in with a certain degree of apprehension. But there the comparison ended, he suggested. For whereas tangoma were, in their own right, clearly activating, mobilising and re-directing agencies in the world to various ends, a lawyer was perhaps better understood as a lincusa, a liaison or intermediary.
The comment took me aback, and for a time it forced me to reconsider the tack I had been taking in my analysis of received law trials involving matters of Swazi governance. For a lincusa is not a person who has any particular specialist knowledge. Indeed, it is not a discrete role, such as a governor (indvund), who might act as a lincusa between an aggrieved person and his/her chief Rather, anyone can be a lincusa, in theory, though to be an effective lincusa requires one to have a certain degree of access and standing vis-a-vis the power or authority which is to be approached. For example, one does not actually have to have a lincusa to see His Majesty, but without one, or with a lincusa who is not a prince, a chief or trusted acquaintance of the monarchy, one would likely sit at the royal palace throughout the night and leave the following morning having never been received by the king.18 More significant, however, is that while in theory a lincusa could refer to any sort of emissary who might announce or introduce two persons of differential status or power, its normal usage always refers specifically to that person who gives you access to the king. Other invocations of a lincusa are rare, and where they do occur, they are derivative of this iconic relation - the person who makes it possible for you to be in the presence of His Majesty, the Ngwenyama.
Presence and magic: thinking through res judicata in Swaziland
In the autumn of 2004, an anticipated day of lobbying in parliament with several colleagues was abruptly suspended with news of an urgent application to be heard in the high court that morning. The Coalition, a consortium of civic organisations including NGOs, church groups, labour unions and the Swaziland Law Society, had been working feverishly for some weeks to prevent the adoption and implementation of the country's new constitution, as it was seen to merely articulate the current (for some, unsatisfactory) state of affairs in the country Now, word came through that an urgent application had been submitted to the high court to interdict the debate of the constitution that was set to begin in parliament that afternoon.Representatives from the Coalition needed to be in high court to follow the proceedings.
So it was that I found myself in the gallery of the high court that morning, accompanied by a colleague from WLSA19 (a local legal NGO) and the director of the Swaziland Federation of Employers. The application was already underway and Pheshaya Dlamini (then Attorney General) had already begun his decimation of the application. His attentions had just turned to his concerns over the locus standae2^ of the applicants, but having had no opportunity to source a copy of the application, none of the three of us could speculate on what his strategy would be. The lawyer presenting tor the applicants was well known to us and a thoroughly competent practitioner, but the AG had a formidable reputation tor finding holes in what seemed to be otherwise airtight applications. So what followed left me dumbstruck.
The AG's first observation with respect to the locus standae of the applicants was that one of them, PUDEMO, was a political organisation, expressly outlawed within both the constitutional framework and by royal decree, and therefore could not bring a case to be heard before any court in the land, much less one which sought to query the legitimacy of the country's constitutional process. I turned to my colleagues. This beggared belief Having only a rudimentary understanding of law myself, the point seemed rather an obvious one and one which would not have been lost on the lawyers presenting in the matter. But my friends merely shrugged and continued to watch with evident enthusiasm. What was there to follow at this point? The application was moribund before it arrived in the courtroom as far as I could see, because the applicants could not even be recognised by the court.
Nonetheless, we spent the entire morning there until such time as the AG had summarised his main heads of argument and was ready to allow the applicants' lawyer his hearing. At this point, however, it was nearly noon, and the bench decided that it would be best to break tor lunch and continue at 1 p.m. The applicants' lawyer interrupted, pointing out that the debate in parliament, which this case sought to interdict, was scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. Would it not be better to simply push on and allow the bench to hear as much of the argument as possible before that time? Chief Justice Annandale did not even consult his colleagues. He replied that he could not change the clocks in parliament, but that what happened in this courtroom would happen in its own time and that this court was now in recess.
In a somewhat desultory mood, my colleagues and I left the gallery and settled that we would head down to Lobamba to follow the parliamentary debate, which was obviously not going to be affected by the court proceedings. During the car journey, I pressed my friends on what had transpired. But surely it had been obvious to the applicants' lawyers that they could not hope to move an application forward in the name of an illegal organisation?And had they really hoped to complete the entire process in the few hours available before the debate in parliament was scheduled to begin, thus rendering the application superfluous by and large? My consternation was met with indifference, and, hal卜teasingly, the only 'explanation' offered was: 'Sari, you must remember you are in Swaziland again!'
That night, I reviewed the morning's events up in the high court with several lawyers, most of whom were unaware that the application had even been lodged. One of them, himself a member of the executive of the Swaziland Law Society, assured me that the question of locus standae would not have been a blind-spot tor the applicants' lawyer. Ah, they were never going to get anywhere with that application. But still, they do these things.' But if it was not the case that a legal error had been made, what was the point of airing an application which could never have proved successful? Or couched in the slightly larger terms which instigated the current essay: What was the impetus for those challenging monarchical authority to approach the received law when nothing decided within received law courts could be enforced against His Majesty's will?
There are a number of 'commonsense' answers to that question that I do not endorse. One line of reasoning might suggest that where one hopes to challenge the limits of monarchical authority, one would not'be inclined to press the matter through 'traditional' legal structures, which are actually seen to be instantiations of divine kingly rule in the first place. Another rejoinder might tally nicely with the chief justice's invocation of the time of law and the extent to which the time of law is out of joint with the time of politics. Perhaps these un-winnable, unenforceable cases are meant to act as a record, testimony left extant in anticipation of a future day of reckoning when the monarchy will be held accountable (cf Moore 1998). While I think that the discontinuities between 'legal time' and 'political time' are hugely relevant here, I cannot see that relationship in instrumental terms, not least because so little effort is made to actually keep a record of court cases in Swaziland. No law reports are published, transcripts and judgements are notoriously hard to track down even days after a case has been heard, and in the case of the urgent application discussed above, for example, the case never merited reporting in either of the country's two newspapers. No - time matters here, but it is not a linear chronological time of befores and afters, causes and effects.21 Rather, the time in question here is the time of kingship and the temporal idiom of immanence.
I asserted earlier that one understanding of the monarchy's relationship to the rule of law might be to see it as a forum for visibly engaging with forms of power and authority which are not Swazi, thus displaying the exceptional capacities of the king. What I want to suggest here is that those who would challenge the immanent and all-encompassing authority of His Majesty are doing much the same. In repeatedly having recourse to the received law in order, ostensibly, to redress the balance of power in purelySwazi matters, those who continue to agitate tor multi-party democracy in the country are demonstrating capacities to negotiate non-Swazi forms of authority which should be the exclusive domain of divine royalty My argument is that the reason why lawyers might often be associated with lincusa is precisely because the law is reified in the social imagination into a unitary entity which can presence the non-Swazi other, just as the black bull pres- enced Swazi kingship.
Lior Barshack, in an article addressing the totemic authority of rule of law systems (2000), anticipates such a possibility, although he is writing about Euro-American engagements with the received law. Drawing on the controversial distinction within anthropology between religion and magic, he follows Riles in suggesting that law works through two modalities. In a religious modality, one finds a focus on transcendence and the absence of the sacred Thing, and as with Riles5 expressive genre of law, the authorising entity is absent, stands apart from and represents the world back to itself However, in a magical modality, 'representation is replaced by immediate presence5 (ibid.: 306).22 Interestingly, Barshak hypothesises an explicit parallel between 'Western5 law and divine kingship, arguing that 'by positing itself the court posits law and order, like the divine king who by the mere fact of being alive sustains the kingdom and the world order5 (ibid.: 307). For Barshack, the rule of law is always and everywhere a magical, reified mode of thinking, and one which defies the search for meaning, because the meaning of the law is simply the presenting of a civic totemic authority It is this renunciation of meaning in favour of immanent presence which accounts for the character of legal formalism - a magical and 'fetishistic5 mode of thinking in Barshack5s account. And so it is that 'The magical enactment performed by the court is complemented by the fiction that the law exists5 (ibid.: 309) - that the law actually is a meaning-artefact, opaque and of the same magnitude as the world itself
In Swaziland, these two genres or modalities would have a particular resonance. For His Majesty displays a similar duality. He is at once, the king, a political suzerain, whose remit is circumscribed by the limits of his position vis-a-vis the people on whose behalf he acts. However, he is also Ngwenyama, the he-lion, whose purview extends indefinitely and in whose person, all former and future kings are conjoined with the totality of the Swazi nation. Swazis are explicit about this: An Ngwenyama is not merely a king. So it is not surprising that modes of presenting - just as the 'black bull presenced His Majesty as Ngwenyama rather than constitutional monarch - are familiar phenomena for Swazis. And these phenomena are necessarily - intrinsically 一 thing-like, collapsing object-in-the-world and world together.
Thus, when Swazi political activists approach the received law on matters pertaining to Swazi governance and the role of the monarchy, their actions are wholly pragmatic in nature 一 as is the case, I would argue, with all forms of magic. But this practical engagement is not best understood in terms ofcause and effect and the calculable ends to which a legal decision might lead (cf Holbraad, Chapter 9 of this volume). Rather, the engagement turns on presencing apposite, parallel forms of authority as if they were of a type with divine kingship. The subversive nature of such acts derives from the fact that it implicitly challenges the notion that the Ngwenyama has exceptional capacities to enact such boundary-crossings. By treating the law as a thing-in-the-world, a concrete and reified manifestation of Western totemic authority, Swazi political 'progressives' put themselves on a par with divine kingship itself, and in so doing, de-stabilise the axiological foundations of the monarchy's cosmological authority.
Umlomo longacali mangaz the mouth that tells no lies
One of the most famous praisenames for the king - a 'name' that directly references the nature of kingship itself in Swaziland - is umlomo longacali manga, or 'the mouth that tells no lies'. This speaks to the Swazi understanding of truth and power in relation to their divine monarch, insofar as what His Majesty says, simply is. It is not the case that whatever he says must be obeyed, believed or affirmed in the face of various other formulations. Rather, 'the mouth that tells no lies' is the immanent entity that constitutes the world, in the moment of his presence, to be one way or the other simply by pronouncing it as so.
A Swazi colleague of mine once conceded that it would be easier to kill a king than to disagree with one, but when I laughed at the remark, he was quick to correct me. 'No, what I mean is that a bad king can be killed, but it is inconceivable that a living one could be wrong. If you disagree with a king, you harm the kingship.'23 Indeed, another friend and informant, a close acquaintance of the king, had once been deeply troubled when the king said to him, 'The people do not want multi-party democracy, no?' His political leanings would have compelled him to disagree had the statement been said by anyone else, but his deep commitment to Swazi kingship made it impossible for the statement to be untrue. His only reply was 6Bayethe", an exclamation which punctuates all intercourse with His Majesty and which can translate either as 'Hail!' or as 'agreement' - 'it is so'.
Thus, as indicated at the start of this essay, Swazis do not see their king as exercising 'power'. In no context would a Swazi say that the king has power (emandla) because it would suggest that he rules by entitlement. Even in the case of the controversial Macetjeni/kamKhweli evictions mentioned earlier, none of the many discussions I was party to were couched in terms of whether the king was entitled to evict the families from their homes. (He was said to have been compelled to do so.) And even in the high court, the one forum where debate over the limits of monarchical authority is routinely raised, argument centred not on what the king can and cannot do, but on the legality of how the act was executed.24 It follows then, from an ontological analysis of the king5s power, that the king5s purview, what He 'can' do so to speak, is imagined as limitless, the encompassing expanse of what it is to be Swazi and to have the Swazi way constituted through the substance of divine kingship.25 Already, one can see that the algorithm which calculates the limits of sovereignty in terms of the decisions a sovereign might undertake makes little sense in a context where the king is seen not to decide what the world is but to constitute it as so. But now we are getting ahead of ourselves.
The question we began with turned on why certain constituencies within Swazi society might have recourse to the received law to arbitrate on the limits (or otherwise) of monarchical power, when any decision taken by the court that displeased His Majesty would never be acted on in any event. I have suggested that such a conceptualisation of power in relation to divine king- ship is salient only in the context of the received law courts, which would account tor why these cases continue to be brought forward. And throughout this piece, I have endeavoured to argue that while Swazis may be engaging with the received law with an eye towards a particular outcome, that outcome is not best understood by focusing on instrumental, cause-and-effect calculations which would yoke the outcome to the court's decision. Rather, the courts, I have argued, prove efficacious because they presence a Western civic totemic authority, a non-Swazi form of power with which only His Majesty should be able to engage. So 'decisions' do not feature here - only engagement, and more to the point, the issue of who has the capacity to engage. The question remains, why can 'power' be conceptualised differently in the received law courts and why are the received law courts alone seized upon as the obvious 'thing' through which to presence a non-Swazi essence?
The key to that question lies in the substitution of engagement for decision. For the emphasis on participation over and above closure/ pronouncement/final adjudication has long 'been observed as a hallmark of SLC (and African customary law more generally). And SLC is understood to emanate directly from the Swazi king - indeed to 'be an instantiation of the nation-in-kingship. So in much the same way as Euro-American scholars have long indulged in a 'what if scenario that posited 'customary law' as the analogue of 'Western' law, presuming that these might be two ways of doing the same 'thing' (law), I contend that Swazis treat the received law as a vehicle to presence a form of power or authority which they conceive of as 'of a type' with divine kingship. And to the extent that we cannot see a familiar form of engagement with the rule of law in my description of Swazi practices in this chapter; we might pause to wonder whether Swazis recognise their custom in Euro-American scholars' evocation of 'customary law'. But for present purposes, we will focus not on the Euro-American elision of custom and law into customary law, but on the Swazi counterpart.
So we are looking at an inversion. In certain instances, I suggest Swazis will treat the rule of law as if it were an analogue to their custom (SLC).And just as one constitutes oneself as part of the nation-in-kingship through the very mobilization of SLC, so too does participation with the received law implicate an engagement with a non-Swazi essence. If the essence and infinite dimensions of Swazi kingship can be ritually presenced, so too, it is believed, can the essence of the non-Swazi, which is presumed to be as infinite in its materialisation as that of kingship. Contra Barshak, I am not suggesting that the received law courts in Swaziland or the 'Western5 civic totem they presence are of a type with divine kingship, only that Swazis will treat them as such. What the Euro-American scholar (who believes custom is an analogue of law) and the Swazi activist (who believes the 'Western5 legal object is presencing something of a type with divine kingship) share, is the conceit that their concepts (of power, of sovereignty, of the authorising force behind 'custom5 and 'law5 respectively) translate adequately. And that is where res judicata comes in.
The legal thing in Swaziland can never be the same sort of object as described in Riles5 discussion of law-as-tool, nor the grander invocation in Euro-American jurisprudence of res judicata. The insufficiency of these renderings derives from the impulse to understand the Swazi Ngwenyama in terms of the concept of 'sovereignty5, where the sovereign not only holds the monopoly over the power to punish, but can decide who is subject to the law and who is not. Where kingly authority is predicated, like 'custom5, on participation and the isomorphic relation of the king and the nation, the very concept of 'sovereignty5 appears as insufficient to understanding the nature (and extent) of the king's 'power5.
Following Agamben (1998), if we look for the sovereign in the exception - in the state of emergency - where will we find him in Swaziland? For the king does not decide what is normal and what is exceptional, as a judge would ruminate over the reasonableness of an action, or whether a context suggested that there were mitigating circumstances to be taken into account. If we embrace, as Eric Wbrby has so eloquently summarised Agamben's arguments of late, that 'sovereignty is revealed to be less about what is included in the protections afforded by citizenship, and more about who decides who is included, and who is excluded, from the protective (or violent) embrace of the law5 (2003:18), then the very concept of 'sovereignty5 appears only to diminish any description of monarchical power. For the Mouth that Tells No Lies is incapable of making a decision, because everything that escapes his lips already is the world.
The king's ability to ignore a ruling, suspend parliamentary and court proceedings and dismiss judges from the bench all prove a red herring. While it is true that Agamben understands the definition of sovereignty as that figure which is both inside and outside of the law, 'having the legal power to suspend the validity of the law, [thus] legally placfing] himself outside the law5 (Wbrby 2003: 15), it is the nature of this 'relation of exception'26 (ibid.: 18) which fails in the Swazi instance. For the king can never place himself ina state of exception, subtracted away from the delimited jurisdiction of a Swazi nation over which he rules. The relationship on which Swazi kingship turns is one of encompassment, not exception (cf Dumont 1981).
Thus, the legal object that this sort of authority would conjure, needs be, is different from the legal object invoked by a political metaphysics of 'sovereignty', a point underscored by Bruno Latour's recent exploration of res judicata (2004). He writes: 'When Roman lawyers intoned the celebrated adage "res judicata pro veritate habetur \ they were declaring that what had been decided should be taken as the truth, which means, precisely, that it should in no way be confused with the truth' (ibid.:109). In Swaziland, there simply is no difference between a 'truth' pronounced and a 'truth' which evades our capacities to disclose it, waiting to be discovered in piecemeal fashion through science or reason or even devotion. Where res judicata proceeds from a conceptualisation of power which is fundamentally about deciding - having the authority to declare something as truth, when in fact the truth (perhaps) is something else altogether, the 'legal thing' in Swaziland proceeds from the knowledge that truth is constituted by the power/essence in which one participates (be it Swazi or otherwise). Thus, to think through the legal thing in Swaziland is to recognise a double failing in our conceptual repertoire. When Swazis engage with the received law - in the context of a particular kind of claim, the limits of monarchy - as if the received law were an analogue to 'custom', we see the limits of understanding this legal object in terms of res judicata. But this only points to a further deficiency For the kind of legal object one is witness to in these scenarios derives from the very conceptualisation of power and authority which underwrites the legal object itself And in Swaziland, this force is so much more than a mere 'sovereign'.
My point here is not to suggest in any way that Swazis are 'mesmerised' by the rule of law or that their engagements with the rule of law are overdetermined by their 'culture'. rIo argue as much would be to contend that Swazis could not act in any other way - that they can only incorporate this foreign formulation of power into their own terms of ontological reference.27 Nothing could 'be further from the truth. Swazis are consummate modernists, and Swazi lawyers accomplished practitioners of the rule of law in every respect. However, it is a matter of ethnographic fact that these peculiar cases, where engagements with the received law prove unanticipated, do exist. My argument is that one does not contradict the other. Rather, in cases involving the otherwise unthinkable question of the limits of monarchical authority, the rule of law is mobilised as if its workings were rooted in the logic of kingship. That Swazis can move between two seemingly incommensurable conceptualisations of 'power' is an index of the ontological alterity of kingship. It is the capacity of the Swazi lawyer to either prosecute a case in a received law court in terms of the jurisdiction it enjoys in statute, or to materialize and engage with a non-Swazi essence through legal ritual, which begins to delineate the actual workings of their divine kingship. To insistthey are somehow trapped in their 'culture' and only capable of one or the other would be to miss the point entirely 一 and with it, the (productive) conceptual failing posed by analysing Swazi kingship in terms of 'sovereignty' or the legal thing in Swaziland in terms of res judicata.
Acknowledgements
This contribution benefited from its earliest hearing in Amiria Henare's Artefacts in Theory' seminar, together with its presentation in a much revised form at a conference convened by Anne Griffiths and Franz von Benda-Beckmann. I gratefully appreciate both invitations to workshop the piece, as well as the many thought-provoking interventions offered by both audiences. I would especially like to thank David Nelkin and David Zammit for their comments both inside and outside of our session in Edinburgh. Additionally, the piece was given a most thorough reading by Beverley Brown, Kirsten Campbell, Eva Franz, Martin Holbraad, Musa Sibandze and an anonymous reader - all of whom moved the work forward in different ways. However; it was Ilana Gershon's comments, together with the many readings she suggested I return to, which made the most fundamental difference. All shortcomings in the work are, of course, very much of the author's making.
Notes
1	My usage of the term res judicata follows certain trends in legal philosophy rather than legal practice. In the latter, res judicata serves as a defence and denotes a matter which has already been heard and decided upon by the court and thus has the standing of a legal fact or a legal °thing'. Obviously, this more black letter usage is not unrelated to broader jurisprudential debates about law and reification, but practising lawyers would not find the use of res judicata appropriate outside descriptions of specific matters brought before the law, rather than as a characterisation of the law as a particular kind of unity The contrastive utility of this term is made explicit in the conclusion to the paper.
2	This was a debate which turned on whether law should best be understood as an autonomous realm of norms that existed outside' of society and therefore adjudicated over social relations distinct from its own ordering (the centralist or positivist position) or as a system - one of many 一 which made up the constituent parts of society and whose operations were inflected by incursions of other such systems (economic, political, educational, etc.) into its workings. For a rich ethnographic exploration in an African context, see Griffiths 1998, where she explores Kwena women's differential access to, and experience og law dependent on their social situations, irrespective of the law's claims to legal equality.
3	Explanations for the invisibility of divine forces, where chiefs must be absent in the proceedings of chiefs, courts for example, go back at least as far as Frazer's discussion of the mortality of gods amongst so-called 'primitive peoples'(1996).
4	For a detailed discussion of Swazi understandings of 'justice' in relation to the received law, see the WLSA volume, Charting the Maze: women in Pursuit ofJustice in Swaziland (2000), a volume in whose research and writing I was also involved.
5	In point of fact, it was not just any two evictees, but the deposed chiefs themselves.
6	The more compelling approach would be to consider the insufficiency of the concept of sovereignty in relation to Swazi divine kingship and allow this inadequacy to prompt the production of a new, more apropos concept - a possibility only signalled, rather than consummately explored, in this chapter's conclusion.
7	The term 'subjects' might prove misleading here, and Douzinas' discussion of subjection and subjectus (2000:183-228) - as the paradoxical dyad which comprises the modern conceptualisation of the legal subject - is instructive in this respect. Following Balibar, Douzinas suggests that subject as subjectus is historically prior, and is 'a political and legal term signifying that someone is subjected to the power or command of a superior, a ruler or sovereign' (ibid.: 217). However, the modem subject is the product of the mutually constitutive, if seemingly incommensurable, re-combination of subject as subjectus and the subject as subjection - a bearer of rights and responsibilities. That is to s明 the modem legal subject is both the creation of the law and law's creator (ibid.: 216). No doubt, this concurs with a Western history of the subject and maps neatly onto the evolution of Western forms of law and governance, but it might equally account for why 'custom' repeatedly fails as an analogue of law and why the sovereignty fostered by Swazi kingship differs from descriptions of medieval European kingships in certain significant ways (to the point that talking about the Swazi king as a 'sovereign' might be a red herring entirely). My contention here is that Swazi sensibilities correlate more closely to the Greek hypokeimenon (from which subjection - as opposed to subjectus - translates (ibid^) or 'the permanent substance or substratum beneath an individual's properties, the underlying essence of a thing' (ibid^), where the 'individual' or 'thing' is actually the Swazi nation-in-kingship (following similar formulations by Dumont 1981).I am not suggesting that all practices of Swazi kingship in recent history have remained true to this formulation. But the fundamental failing of most assessments of the monarchy in Swaziland stems directly from the fact that the Swazi belief that one cannot distinguish the kingship from bakaNgwanelths nation, is rendered as a mere discourse of kingship at best or a contrived political ideology at worst. It is not. In Swaziland, both the conceptualisation of (what a EuroAmerican would equate to) the legal subject and the nature of sovereignty are products of the indissolubility of king and nation, and this has translated directly into the highly articulated governmental structure which predates the country's colonial era by more than a century
8	In many ways, this argument is entirely confluent with that made by Sahlins in his book, Islands of History (1985), where the 'Other' (in his case, the arrival of Captain Cook in Hawai'i) is assimilated into pre-existing social templates or practices. The principle difference (aside from the fact that I am not pursuing anything like the structural-historical analysis offered by Sahlins) would be that in the Swazi case, this sort of encompassment also seeks to preserve the 'other' qua other, a dissimilarity my contribution also shares with Henare's chapter in this volume.
9	Although I would also qualify that claim by underscoring the fact that the analysis of that reification is very much my own.
10	Of course law is not alone in holding up a mirror to the contradictions inherent in anthropological knowledge production. Foucault's suggestion that 'discourse
creates its objects5 was always both an enabling theoretical framework for anthropology and a damning indictment of anthropology's workings in equal measure.
11	Importantly for Riles' argument, both the expressive and instrumental genres are present in every act of law-making (ibid.: 205).
12	Indeed, one of the most striking things about the newspaper coverage of high court cases and parliamentary debates is the frequency with which proceedings are explained in terms of the rules of court or the rules of parliament. Although often ancillary to the substantive content of an article, the formalities which govern these proceedings are often treated as intrinsic to understanding what actually transpired.
13	Kings must be right-handed, and a left-handed prince, otherwise eligible for succession, is wholly disqualified solely by this feature. Bonner implies that this was a mid-eighteenth-century innovation to disqualify the young prince Magudulela (Bonner 1983: 47), who would have been the seventh Swazi king were he not passed over for his brother Ludvonga I, but the Swazi historian J. S. M. Matsebula suggests otherwise (as indicated in a footnote to his genealogical table of the Royal Dlaminis included in his book,1988). Indeed, the story I was once told tallied better with Matsebula's account, namely, his mother; anxious to avoid the pressures of becoming a queen mother should her son ascend to the throne, had engineered his left-handedness by plunging the child's right hand into a boiling pot, such that the disfigurement caused him to privilege his left hand as he grew and developed. If true, this would mitigate against the idea that Magudulela's disqualification for kingship due to his left-handedness was an impromptu invention used to thwart his claims to succession - although it is impossible to say whether the story of the boiling beer vat was manufactured post facto to legitimate the justifications for his exclusion. In any event, right-handedness remains a direct reference to kingship in a wide variety of contexts. The Mavuso clan, who for historical reasons might have certain claims to kingship themselves, begin their praisename with nkhosi (king), mavuso, mavuso waNgwane (Mavuso of Ngwane - or descended from Ngwane from whom all Swazi kings descend), only then to qualify ncele likhohlwa lemtimkhulu (left-handed one from the big house).
14	The observation holds for the kingdom's governance structures, where a 'modem, (as the Swazis would describe it) bicameral parliament and governmental ministries exist in tandem with the 'traditional,system of chieftaincies and their governors (tindvuna) who maintain allegiance to His Majesty and the queen mother.
15	This state of affairs persisted throughout my fieldwork between 1998 and 2004, during which time the king's supra-legal status was put forward in the Constitutional Framework. With the adoption of the long-awaited constitution in late July 2005, this state of affairs has now been permanently entrenched.
16	In a variety of different contexts, it has been observed that the quality of king- ship is often refracted in individuals and offices across a society although in practice, such processes of refraction will vary Sometimes all members of a society will have some measure of kingly power/essence, albeit the degree they exhibit will extend across a wide spectrum. In others, such diminutions of kingly 'substance' are exclusive to a small cadre of elite (see Quigley 2005: 2, for an abbreviated discussion in general and Drucker-Brown 2005 for a rich ethnographic case study in this respect). In the case of Swaziland, this phenomenon has been overstated in my opinion, leading to an emphasis on the stratified and 'aristocratic' character of the society (Kuper 1947) at the expense of a full consideration of how this stratification relates to the encompassing nature of Swazi kingship (Wastell forthcoming). 17	INcwala is a cleansing ceremony, which fortifies the person of His Majesty and ensures the fertility and health of the nation for the coming year. As such, it confounds a distinction between a 'positive' theory of kingship (one where the perfection of the monarch equates to the well-being of the nation) and the so- called 'negative' theories, which understand the king as a sacred scapegoat who takes on the ills of the nation and periodically expells them (cf Quigley 2005:10; and Scubla 2005), as the Swazi iNcwala clearly performs both functions. For an authoritative account of the ritual and its purpose, see Matsebula 1988.

21	Particular thanks to David Nelkin who chased me on this point and articulated it in these terms, and more generally for the discussions he shared with me on the extent to which 'cultural sensibilities' at minimum inflect, or more strongly put, positively colonise the practice of the rule of law.
22	Barshack's discussion of the religious versus magical modalities of law exhibits numerous parallels with Riles' distinction between the expressive versus the instrumental mode, not all of which can be explored here. Most importantly for the argument put forward here is the fact that both see law as alternating between being a thing-in-the-world and an external position from which to observe and constitute the world in particular ways: 'In one of its facets, the law is a sacred Thing, a presence, while in another facet it is a word, reason and hegemonic system of representation that assumes the normative separation between subject and Thing' (Barshack 2000: 320).
23	The remark echoes the observation of many scholars that the phrase 'The king is dead; long live the king!' is an aphorism for the dual nature of kingship as both person and office.
24	For an extended discussion of the high court appeal case over the evictions, see chapter 7 in Wastell forthcoming.
25	Of course, the important corollary to this, as we shall see, is that Swazis go on to presume that the encompassing nature of the king's being - 'power' understood as an essence of which they are a part - is a shared characteristic of non-Swazi 'power'. While kingship is potentially infinite - capable of encompassing anything - it also defines itsdf against all that is non-Swazi. To be Swazi has little to do with blood quorum or any conceptualisation of 'ethnicity'. It is to be one in the body and person of the king. But equally, it is recognised that not everybody is part of the essence of Swazi kingship. Thus, the non-Swazis are imagined to part of another (non-Swazi) essence.
26	Agamben defines the 'relation of exception' as 'the extreme form of relation by which something is included solely through its exclusion' (ibid.: 18).
27	And here again is the salient difference between my account and that of Sahlins (1985).

Anthropology and Anthropologists:
The Modern British School (3rd edition)
Adam Kuper
'Its great merit is that it not only describes all major developments in
method, theory and controversy; it also gives much biographical informa-
tion about the persons responsible for those developments ... Kuper writes
lucidly, economically, and occasionally with refreshing irreverence.5
British Book News
On its first publication in 1973 Adam Kuper's entertaining history of half
a century of British social anthropology provoked strong reactions. But his
often irreverent account soon established itself as one of the introductions
to anthropology.
Since the second revised edition was published in 1983, important developments have occurred within British and European anthropology. This third enlarged and updated edition responds to these fresh currents. Adam Kuper takes the story up to the present day, and a new final chapter traces the emergence of a modem European social anthropology in contrast with the developments in American cultural Anthropology over the last two decades.
Anthropology and Anthropologists provides a critical historical account of modem British social anthropology: it describes the careers of the major theorists, their ideas and their contributions in the context of the intellectual and institutional environments in which they worked. It is essential reading tor all students of social anthropology; it will also appeal to lay readers with an interest in the field.
Adam Kuper is Professor of Anthropology at Brunel University. He has taught at universities in Uganda, Britain, Sweden, Holland the the United States and was the founding chairman of the European Association of Social Anthropologists. He is the author of a number of books on the history of anthropology and on African ethnography, including The Invention of Primitive Society (1988) and The Chosen Primate (1994).

The Reinvention of Primitive Society:
Transformations of a Myth
Adam Kuper
The Invention of Primitive Society, Adam Kuper's decisive critique of ideas about the origins of society and religion that have been debated since Darwin, has been hugely influential in anthropology and post-colonial studies. This iconoclastic intellectual history showed that 'primitive society5 was the imagined opposite to Western civilisation. By way of fascinating accounts of classic texts in anthropology, classical studies and law, the book revealed how wholly mistaken theories can become the basis for academic research and political programmes.
The publication of this expanded and radically revised new edition, now entitled The Reinvention of Primitive Society, coincides with a revival of the myth of primitive society by the 'indigenous peoples movement5, which taps into a widespread popular belief about the noble savage, and reflects a romantic reaction against 'civilization5 and 'science5. In a new final chapter, Kuper challenges this most recent version of the myth of primitive society Another new chapter traces conceptions of the barbarian, savage and primitive back through the centuries to ancient Greece. The remaining chapters have all been recast and updated to take new research into account.
The Reinvention of Primitive Society: Transformations of a Myth is essential reading tor readers interested in anthropological theory and current post-colonial debates, and indeed tor anyone who is curious about the ways in which we systematically misunderstand other peoples.

The Future of Visual Anthropology:
Engaging the Senses
Sarah Pink
The explosion of visual media in recent years has generated a wide range of visual and digital technologies which have transformed visual research and analysis. The result is an exciting new interdisciplinary approach of great potential influence in and out of academia.
Sarah Pink argues that this potential can be harnessed by engaging visual anthropology with its wider contexts, including:
•	The increasing use of visual research methods across the social sciences and humanities
•	The growth in popularity of the visual as methodology and object of analysis within mainstream anthropology and applied anthropology
•	The growing interest in 'anthropology of the senses' and media anthropology.
•	The development of new visual technologies that allow anthropologists to work in new ways.
The Future of Visual Anthropology offers a groundbreaking examination of developments within the field to define how it might advance empirically, methodologically and theoretically, and cement a central place in academic study both within anthropology and across disciplines. This book will be essential reading for students, researchers and practitioners of visual anthropology, media anthropology, visual cultural studies, media studies, and sociology.

Arguing with Anthropology:
An Introduction to Critical Theories of the Gift
Karen Sykes
,It is something of a stroke of genius to make gift exchange the guiding thread of an introductory book... Sykes introduces many of the most important debates that dominate anthropology today. As that rare book that accessibly introduces students to the discipline without talking down to them, I think this book will be widely used.'
Joel Robbins, University of California San Diego
Arguing with Anthropology is a fresh and original guide to key elements in anthropology, which teaches the ability to think, write and argue critically Through an exploration of the classic 'question of the gift', which functions in anthropology as a definitive example of the entire human experience, it provides a fascinating study course in anthropological methods, aims, knowledge and understanding. The book's unique approach takes gift-theory 一 the science of obligation and reciprocity - as the paradigm for a virtual enquiry which explores how the anthropological discipline has evolved historically how it is applied in practice and how it can be argued with critically. By giving clear examples of real events and dilemmas, and asking students to participate in arguments about the form and nature of enquiry, it offers working practice of dealing with the obstacles and choices involved in anthropological study
•	From an experienced teacher whose methods are tried & tested
•	Comprehensive & fun course for intermediate-level students
•	Clearly defines the functions of anthropology, and its key theories and arguments
•	Effectively teaches core study skills for exam success & progressive learning
•	Draws on a rich variety of Pacific and global ethnography
Karen Sykes is a Senior Lecturer in anthropology at the University of Manchester, where she teaches a popular introductory course in anthropology. She received her doctorate from Princeton University in 1995 and has conducted research in Melanesia since 199〇.
