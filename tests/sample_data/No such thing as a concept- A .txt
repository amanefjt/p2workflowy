In light of renewed questions about the relationship between anthropology’s past and future, two radicalizations of the British tradition are particularly worth exploring: those of Talal Asad and Marilyn Strathern, arguably the most widely read anthropologists beyond the discipline, and the most regularly misunderstood. Asad and Strathern are rarely engaged together because the anthropologies that their works have inspired operate quite separately, their mutual implications left unexplored. And yet, tracing the development of Asad’s and Strathern’s respective work reveals a deep resonance, beginning with their training in the concern with translation, which owes more to Malinowski than anthropologists today are generally aware. The paper argues that reading Asad and Strathern together can help mitigate the over-cultivation of the “concept” in recent anthropology, multiply insights into the constitutive relations among anthropology, science and the secular, and refine perspectives on the legacy of British anthropology and on anthropology’s future politics.

Talal Asad and Marilyn Strathern are arguably the most widely read anthropologists beyond the discipline, yet they have rarely been discussed together. Their first field sites and monographs were continents and conversations apart: Asad (1970) studied political authority among North African nomads in the Sudan, while Strathern (1972) wrote on the Papua New Guinean Highlands, kinship, and gender. Furthermore, these beginnings drew them into very different debates: on politics, religion, and the secular (among others) for Asad, and on exchange, science, and law (among others) for Strathern.
Yet from these very different perspectives, Asad’s and Strathern’s scholarship nevertheless intersect. When read alongside one another, it becomes clear that each is elucidated, even transformed, through the terms of the other. Indeed as we will see, Asad’s mature work is more explicitly concerned than Strathern’s with describing-while-decomposing the concepts that animate the Euro-American secular domain and its “politics”: from the secular’s defining distinction between politics and religion, to the state doctrine of secularism that helps regulate these distinctions vis a` vis the individual—a set of relations I also call here “secularist.” For her part, Strathern is more overtly concerned with displacing the concepts of individual-society and their metaphysical effects in order to better write through relations. That is, she consistently writes to enact the point that relations (interpersonal and conceptual) are the grounds of knowledge and should therefore be privileged over the analytical concept. Different as they may be, reading Asad and Strathern together nevertheless reveals a deep resonance that derives from their roots in the concern with translation in social anthropology. And recognizing this resonance is where we can begin transforming our understanding of each: though she hardly ever uses the term “secular,” when read alongside Asad, Strathern emerges as a student of the ever-proliferating Euro-American secular and its implications for scholarship. Read alongside Strathern, Asad appears as privileging relations over the analytical concept, even as he focuses on conceptual relations and shifts.
In short, reading Asad and Strathern together helps consolidate insights into the history and legacy of British social anthropology and offers valuable tools, not for replicating their modes of writing, or immediately escaping the secular (an impossibility for now in any case), but for always remaining attuned to the spread of secular knowledge and its most potentially distorting, even colonizing, secularist concepts and forms.
To animate this argument we must look at the development of their respective oeuvres and explore four crucial points where their scholarship meets. I start with how their mature work builds on a position found in more embryonic form in the British anthropological tradition beginning with Malinowski: that there is no such thing as a concept, that concepts always exist in relation, including partaking in, and being shaped by, relations beyond the conceptual. The first two sections below elaborate this point, discussing the cultural translation school of British social anthropology and its often occluded debts to Malinowski which I show inspired Asad’s and Strathern’s increasingly radical modes of description. Indeed, if Strathern and Asad are often perceived to have achieved a degree of sui generis “theoretical” notoriety,1 grounding their work in a tradition first borne by Malinowski—known for his fieldwork, and often written off as being theoretically “soft” (Douglas, 2003 [1980): 37)— transforms our understanding of all three scholars.
The second point of intersection between Asad’s work and Strathern’s work is where we can start to see their differences and their resonances more clearly, and thus begin to shift our understandings of each. In an exploration of their respective concern with the human (Asad) and the individual (Strathern), Strathern emerges more as a student of the Euro-American secular than she has appeared before. It is true that in addition to not using the term secular, Strathern hardly ever refers to religion: the concept whose relation to, and distinction from, a host of other concepts constitutes and animates the modern secular domain (concepts including politics, nature, even reality, see Lebner, 2019). Nevertheless, like Asad, Strathern is acutely aware that the notion of the autonomous, self-owning human individual should not be considered a “natural” object of anthropological analysis. Yet here is another difference: the denaturalization of the individual (and the individual’s perennial companion, secularism) is an outcome or end of Asad’s analysis, while the displacement of the individual (and its perennial companion, society) is the beginning of Strathern’s. Still, in light of Asad’s work, Strathern’s critical eye for the concepts that secure the individual can first be read as an awareness of the proliferation of the secular. With that perspective, Strathern’s displacements of the individual and its analogues can be grasped as writing against the secularist state’s norms of differentiation—against its colonization of relations in both politics and ethnography.
The third point of convergence between Asad’s and Strathern’s work has to do with the radical, if very different, experiments both scholars have undertaken with writing style. Asad develops a fluid and provisional way of writing aimed at undermining conventional forms of reason and argumentation, while showing that the secular, which is genealogically built around core conceptual oppositions, is itself always in transformation, and is therefore difficult to grasp, and ultimately difficult to escape. For her part, Strathern’s writing conveys both less and more hope of “escape.” While Strathern maintains that we will long remain trapped in our own scholarly languages of description (inherited from the Enlightenment; Strathern, 2005), she has devised a way to carve out another, more relational, less individualizing, less secularist metaphysic by displacing the individual and society not only as concepts, but also as metaphysical analytical form: because concepts, and especially these concepts, can structure the way we think about analysis, from the conventional notion of (individual, transcendent) authorship to the idea of theory-building as somehow distinct from ethnography.
Finally, with Strathern’s relational writing in view, Asad’s writing can also begin to be read differently, and another point of intersection—and transformation—becomes clear: though Asad is not known as a relational thinker, he can be read to be writing through relations. That is, he can be read as foregrounding, like Strathern, how relations are what constitute, and promise, conceptual shifts and transformations in secular knowledge.
The central aim of this paper, then, is to show that Asad and Strathern are part of the same tradition and, when read together, their differences become tools that can help grasp, navigate, and write through the perennial constraints of secular scholarly knowledge and keep transforming it. I say perennial, as reading Asad with Strathern teaches us that we may never definitively (for now) depart the secular, precisely because it is not merely the religion–secular binary that needs to be “overcome”—a truism that is now repeated in contemporary scholarship well beyond Asad’s original interlocutors (Haraway, 2016). Rather, scholars should become more attuned to how numerous relations and distinctions constitute the secular, how these condition contemporary scholarship, and how to mitigate their weightiest effects. In particular, scholars should be aware of how secularist metaphysics—the conceptual and interpersonal relations and distinctions that animate state secularism—can quietly insinuate themselves into, colonize, and distort, our ethnographies and our politics. With this in view, we can begin seeking alternative metaphysics even within our current scholarly languages that allow for difference to emerge, facilitating transformations in description and knowledge.
Of course, given my necessarily close focus on their work, much will remain in the background. Yet in conclusion, I will gesture to other influences on their work and to ways to write through their collective insights going forward. Conjuring the 1980s crisis in representation via Clifford Geertz’s response to Writing Culture will throw the scholarship of these two radicalizing anthropologists into further relief and show how reading them side by side might help move us through some current scholarly impasses. My suggestions, useful to keep in mind in what follows, will be that reading Asad and Strathern in parallel can help reanimate the subfields inspired by their work: on secularism and on science, respectively. More broadly, their scholarship incites us to be more aware of the proliferation of both secular concepts and secularist concepts. Even with overlaps, also perceiving differences between them can help transform what we might grasp as anthropology’s politics. I will clarify as I conclude.
Translation and the critique of concepts in British social anthropology
The idea of anthropology as a practice of translation is still with us. In fact, Asad’s paper on cultural translation in British anthropology first published in Writing Culture (1986) and later reprinted at the heart of his Genealogies of Religion (1993), remains a reference for new discussions on these matters, though they move off in their own creative directions (Viveiros de Castro, 2004). My concern, however, is not to engage recent thinking. Rather—and before showing how Asad and Strathern critically engage translation—I want to re-establish that the concern with translation was a vital part of Malinowski’s legacy. This is not a minor historical detail, either for the discipline or for this paper. Indeed Malinowski’s legacy in this regard has been consciously and unconsciously repressed from the mid-twentieth century forward. Restoring an understanding of Malinowski’s influence and how it has been sidelined will show Asad’s and Strathern’s deep connections, and also re-situate their work as interventions in a discussion about concepts and ethnography that stretches back to the inception of anthropology in Britain.
There is a longstanding misconception that an interest in translation emerged suddenly in the post-war period under the leadership of Evans-Pritchard at Oxford. For example, Louis Dumont referred to Evans-Pritchard’s 1950 Marret Lecture, where he described anthropology as an art of translating between cultures, as the explosion of a “bomb” in the discipline (Dumont, 1975[1968]: 334).2 While few anthropologists now recall Dumont’s account, his idea that the “translation school” originated with Evans-Pritchard is extended in the present by Asad’s own brief comments on the matter (as I personally can attest; Lebner, 2016b)—and by a piece by Ernest Gellner that Asad (1986) critically engages: Gellner’s still influential “Concepts and Society” (1970[1962]; e.g., see narratives in Collins, 1985; Corsın-Jime´ nez and Willerslev, 2007; Holbraad, 2017). As we will see, despite their profound differences, Asad and Gellner both minimize Malinowski’s own concerns with translation (see also Douglas, 2003[1980]3).
“The translation of cultures,” Asad notes, has “increasingly become an almost banal description of the distinctive task of...anthropology ...[Yet it] was not always so much in evidence” (1986: 141). Malinowski, Asad states, “one of the founders of the so-called functionalist school, wrote much on ‘primitive language’ and collected enormous quantities of linguistic material (proverbs, kinship terminology ...) for anthropological analysis. But he never thought of his work in terms of the translation of cultures” (ibid.: 141). It may be true that Malinowski did not organize his work around this phrase initially, but Asad’s claim is misleading: by 1935, Malinowski was defining the anthropologist’s “task” in essentially those terms: to “translate the native point of view to the European” (1935: ix).
But even at the beginning of his career, Malinowski deemed cultural description, and more importantly ethnographic fieldwork, to be conditions of possibility for any translation of terms and vice versa. He was concerned, for example, with
the task of bringing home to a European reader the vocabulary of a strange tongue. And the main result of our analysis was that it is impossible to translate words of a primitive language or of one widely different from our own, without giving a detailed account of the culture of its users and thus providing the common measure necessary for a translation. (Malinowski, 1923: 470)
John Firth, a leading British linguist, cited this passage in his contribution to Raymond Firth’s Festschrift for Malinowski, noting that Malinowski was recognized even beyond anthropology as consistently concerned with the problem of translation (ibid.: 94). He even suggested that Malinowski’s early work found echoes in Wittgenstein (ibid.), a resonance that would be subsequently repressed by commentators (see below and notes 2 and 3).
The concern with translation and concepts deepened during Malinowski’s career. In Coral Gardens and their Magic (1935) Malinowski radicalized his earlier stance.
There is no science whose conceptual, hence verbal, outfit is not ultimately derived from the practical handling of matter. I am laying considerable stress on this because, in one of my previous writings, I opposed civilised and scientific to primitive speech, and argued as if the theoretical uses of words in modern philosophic and scientific writing were completely detached from their pragmatic sources. This was an error, and a serious error at that. Between the savage use of words and the most abstract and theoretical one there is only a difference of degree. (Malinowski, 1935: 58)
It is not coincidental that Ernest Gellner cited this passage in his last, posthumously published book, Language and Solitude, where he lamented that Malinowski had denied the existence of “culturally-transcendent” concepts, moving Malinowski even further away from a rationalist position (Gellner, 1998: 152–153).
Certainly, structural-functionalists minimized talk of Malinowski’s influence on the discipline (Kuper, 2015[1973], see also Note 3). However, a good part of the responsibility for the repression of Malinowski’s thinking on concepts must be laid at the feet of Gellner, who marshaled Malinowski throughout his career to buttress an agenda that he only partially in jest called “Enlightenment Secular Fundamentalism” or “Enlightenment Rationalist Fundamentalism” (Gellner, 1992: 76, 80; Skorupski, 1996). This agenda included a campaign waged since his first book (Gellner, 1959), which was written to counter Wittgensteinianism in philosophy—in particular its rejection of overformalized abstractions or concepts. Gellner’s aim instead was to establish the asymmetry and primacy of Western scientific knowledge and concepts over other (especially religious) knowledges. As Chris Hann (1996) puts it, Gellner, who left philosophy for anthropology, “seized upon” Malinowskian empiricism “as an attractive synthesis and antidote” to Wittgensteinianism (ibid.: 46). The result was that Gellner, in both his own work and in Malinowski’s, “downplay[ed] the concepts through which people live their lives” (ibid.: 61).
It is worth noting a key example of how Gellner curated Malinowski’s legacy during his lifetime: his essay “Concepts and Society” (1970[1962]), whose arguments have since been creatively deployed, though less critically than they deserve (Collins, 1985; Corsın Jime´ nez and Willerslev, 2007; Holbraad, 20174). “Concepts and Society” centers on the “over-charitable defense” of indigenous concepts among anthropologists practicing cultural translation. Rather than discussing Malinowski’s early views on translation as a source of these ideas, he hearkens back to Durkheim’s critical engagement with Kant.5 However, Durkheim was much more partial to Kant’s a priori universal categories than Gellner allows (Durkheim, 2001[1912]; Schmaus, 2004: 15). That is, Durkheim was certainly more universalist and rationalist regarding concepts than Malinowski was.
Malinowski was skeptical of universalizing categories—and skeptical to a certain extent of Durkheim (Young, 2004: 237). And here, a surprise: this is evident from even before his Trobriand fieldwork, as attested by his 1913 review of Durkheim’s Elementary Structures of Religious Life. There, Malinowski questioned Durkheim’s “bipartition of men, things, and ideas into ‘sacre´ et profane’...religious and non-religious...But is it universal?” Malinowski asked rhetorically, “I feel by no means persuaded” (1913: 526). He also questioned Durkheim’s concept of society, which he argued “must [be] label[led as] an entirely metaphysical conception,” because Durkheim endows it “with all properties of individual consciousness [i.e., will, aims, and desires]” (ibid.: 528).
Malinowski’s critiques of Durkheim are especially relevant here because Asad and Strathern radicalized this skepticism about the concepts of “religion” and “society,” as we will see. These critiques also remind us that, from Malinowski forward, anthropology has been concerned with the problematization of both scholarly and native concepts through ethnography. To be sure, Malinowski did not reject all theory or concepts (he was very partial to the “individual,” for example). Yet Malinowski represented a shift from Frazerian and Durkheimian evolutionism to modern ethnography precisely because of his concern to bring the understanding of concepts in their context to the writing of ethnography. Strathern writes, “What must be laid at Malinowski’s door is the proclamation of the kinds of spaces that had to be made in ethnographic writing to convey ‘new’ analytical ideas” (Strathern 1987a: 259). It is the result of this proclamation that, thereafter, “modern ethnographers sought to dislodge the taken-for-granted status of Western concepts,” and so “the development of a technical terminology [in anthropology] proceeded hand in hand with self-scrutiny” (ibid.: 206). In other words, Malinowski promoted the understanding of indigenous ideas through ethnography in order to re-order anthropological concepts.
This discussion leads me to the following conclusion: cultural translation became popular neither because it was entirely new, confectioned independently by the “Oxford School,” nor because it was a direct prescription of Durkheim’s. Instead, we must acknowledge that although Malinowski saw the need for anthropologists to “at times, go beyond the verbal and even...beyond the conceptual outfit of the natives” he was convinced that “in building up his concepts the ethnographer must never go beyond native facts” (1935: 18–19). Indeed, by focusing on “context” above all, Malinowski was translating and transforming Durkheimian sociological insights for a new discipline, social anthropology, and a new genre of writing, ethnography. Thus pace Gellner, Malinowski shaped an anthropological tradition at odds with the kind of secular Enlightenment fundamentalism that Gellner sought to defend.
This is not to say that Malinowski was not promoting a secular form of knowledge, he certainly was: it was Malinowski who “effectively brought the historical partnership between British anthropologists and missionaries to an end” (Young 2004: 333). Though if Malinowski developed professional fieldwork methods to free anthropology from the religious biases in missionary reports, he also did so to begin interrogating established concepts and distinctions through ethnography. As such, though Malinowski did not speak in these terms, we can say that through a new secular tradition, Malinowski began interrogating the secularist faith in a reality grounded in conceptual stability (e.g. ‘religion,’ ‘society’) that Asad and Strathern would later go on to decompose.
Asad, Strathern and the “political turn” in anthropology
I have foregrounded Malinowski in order to demonstrate how Asad’s and Strathern’s work radicalize a tradition present since the beginning of the discipline—not to disregard the fact that anthropology in Britain was seen as increasingly fragmented from the 1960s. In fact, Asad discussed this fragmentation in his introduction to Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter, which reflected a general awareness that what had united the discipline until the mid-twentieth century—the aim of documenting, comparing, and typologizing the structures of primitive societies—no longer seemed to be a theoretically or politically worthy goal in the shadow of decolonization (Asad, 1973a; see also Kuper, 2015[1973]). Asad explained that anthropologists began to focus on a “multitude of fragmentary problems—political, economic, domestic, cultic, etc.” (Asad, 1973a: 13) and ultimately turned to other disciplines for theoretical inspiration, especially those offering more political angles.
I do not debate this account of disciplinary change, yet we should also consider how Asad’s and Strathern’s responses to what we could call the discipline’s “political turn” help us see the tradition they were transforming more clearly. Asad’s subsequent engagement with the critique of colonialism and Marxism, and Strathern’s engagement with feminism eventually produced similar results: they intensified their critiques of the conceptual conventions of newly-influential debates in anthropology.
Asad: Marxism and beyond, 1970–1993
Key exegetical works barely mention the British tradition as an inspiration for Asad’s work (Anidjar, 2010; Scott and Hirschkind, 2006). This may be because Asad was a vocal critic of predominant social anthropology from early in his career. For example, in his thematic contribution to Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter, “Two European Images of Non-European Rule” (1973b), Asad discusses the “ideological dimensions” of anthropological theories of political consent, which added to his discussion in The Kababish Arabs (1970). In particular, Asad (1973b) notes that the functionalist description, propounded by Fortes and Evans-Pritchard, of African political systems as consent-based, ultimately legitimated the twentieth-century colonial project in Africa—as much as the older orientalist view of Islamic rule as “despotic” justified an earlier period of colonial expansion.
On the basis of this critique, Asad called for an anthropology more aware of the ways that power in the West is “linked to the practical conditions, the working assumptions, and the intellectual product of all disciplines representing the European understanding of a non-European humanity” (1973b: 19). Thus even before Asad’s turn to Foucault in the 1980s, he was calling for an anthropology that would consider how various powers shaped its concepts and therefore knowledge. Through the 1970s, Asad was consistently critical of anthropological concepts and texts, especially those by political and economic anthropologists (e.g., his discussions of rationality (1974) and ethnicity (1975)). Today, Asad is perhaps best known for his critique of religion (especially of Clifford Geertz’s definition) and for showing that religion was not a neutral or stand-alone analytical concept, but was a product of a particular Western, Christian, and secular history (Asad, 1983, 1993; see discussion in Lebner, 2015, 2016b).
Asad’s critique of religion was clearly geared to distinguish his project from Geertzian cultural anthropology. Yet it can also be seen as ushering in a period of re-engagement with the British anthropological tradition. Asad’s (1983) discussion of religion built on decades of debate on the category of belief (Evans-Pritchard 1956; Needham 1973; Pouillon 1979; Ruel 1982), and it was followed soon after by his contribution to Writing Culture, on translation in British anthropology (1986). Scholars seem to consider this piece merely a moment of theoretical interest (Scott and Hirschkind, 2006: 5), with Asad perhaps recalling an older anthropological modality in order to dispose of it, much as the other contributors to Writing Culture seemed keen to do. Nevertheless, to see Asad as aiming to disqualify the British tradition, and the school of cultural translation, is incorrect.
Instead, Asad hoped to make “the anthropological task of translation more coherent” (1986: 156). To do so, he pointed precisely to the blind spots of Gellner’s “Concepts and Society” (1970[1962]). In essence, Asad argued that Gellner’s concern with replacing “over-charitable” translations with a program of pointing out irrational “nonsense” was blind to the “inequality of [descriptive] languages” (1986: 156). Blind, that is, to how Western languages, and English in particular, have enormous power to both represent and ultimately modify the receiving language. Asad argued that anthropologists should explore the “asymmetrical tendencies and pressures in the languages of dominated and dominant societies as means to render their ‘cultural translations’ more coherent and informed” (1986: 164). While this echoes Asad’s early discussion in Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter, it also shows a greater willingness to engage and recuperate the tools of the British tradition in which he was trained. Indeed, Asad was developing the very idea of tradition at the same time—in particular, how the concept of tradition might help build an anthropology of Islam. Though Asad does not refer to social anthropology as a tradition, the notion nevertheless captures the sense that social anthropology has been built around a series of texts and entails a set of discourses and debates that have variously oriented intellectual and ethical practice through time (Asad, 1986: 146). Combined with his reading of Foucault, it was Asad’s re-engagement with the British concern with “translation” that ultimately helped convince him that Marxism’s conceptual apparatus also brought its own obscuring assumptions. This brings us to the first point at which Asad’s work meets Strathern’s.
Strathern: Before and after feminism, 1970–1987
It happened so quickly that no one seemed to notice: Strathern went from engaging the notion of translation (e.g., Strathern, 1985, 1987b) to declaring it a “fancy” (Strathern, 1988). Yet this shift is important: Strathern’s entire oeuvre from Gender of the Gift onwards is written on the premise that it is ultimately impossible to fully translate the knowledge practices of others into “our own” descriptive languages (Lebner, 2017a). Nevertheless, it is not only her critical engagement with the idea of translation that places Strathern in the same tradition with Asad; it is also her response to the political turn in British anthropology.
Strathern did not quite have an extended feminist period in the same way that Asad had a Marxist period. First it was the ethnographic demands of her field site (as well as growing up with a “pre-feminist feminist mother”) that inspired her to write a monograph focused on women—becoming one of the first anthropologists to do so (Viveiros de Castro, Fausto and Strathern, 2017, 42). She was drawn further into feminist debate when Annette Weiner accused her of male bias (ibid.; Weiner, 1976). Her response began by reaffirming core social anthropological principles that she would then come to radicalize.
Strathern responded to Weiner’s critique in her Malinowski Lecture of 1980 (given the year after Asad marked his first departure from Marxist anthropology at the same podium; see Asad, 1979; Strathern, 1981). “Notions such as male bias or the woman’s point of view” Strathern said, “can be tremendously productive, and certainly alter the way we ‘see’...Yet the sounds of our own industry should not deafen us to the point of forgetting that others are creative too” (1981: 684). While her appetite for direct critique changed with the development of her particular form of redescription, and I speak to this below, her response to Weiner’s feminist provocation marked a deepening of her interest in the challenge that indigenous knowledge practices posed to Euro-American scholarly trends.
Initially, Strathern adopted a critical strategy similar to that which Asad was pursuing around this time, though instead of interrogating consent, religion, belief, or ritual, Strathern began to question nature, culture, law, social control, and inequality and, finally, the individual, transforming her writing style in the process.
It is worth pausing on Strathern’s interrogation of inequality, for it gives us insight into her radical displacement of conventional analytical concepts, due precisely to her view of their deep interconnections. Though Asad was always intent on questioning key anthropological concepts, he did not ultimately question analytic concerns with power, inequality, and politics, so directly. Strathern’s edited volume Dealing with Inequality announced a self-conscious position that she had been refining from the time she was drawn into the debate by Weiner: that the conventional understandings of inequality often mobilized in discussions of sex and gender invoke a network of concepts informed by Western models of “industrial process” (Strathern, 1987b: 285). This series of concepts includes the notion of hierarchy confronting and being challenged by individual agency, and the series draws power from “a pervasive notion of society’s industry in relation to the natural world, a cosmology that sees transformative process at the heart of the individual:society or nature:culture relationship” (Strathern, 1987b: 300, Note 3). Strathern only hinted here at the broader critique of “individual:society” that appeared in Gender of the Gift in the following year, yet it is clear that the metaphor from capitalist industry, which is also echoed in her original response to Weiner, helps open the question of whether feminist critique, and conventional anthropological understandings of human agency more generally, are as emancipatory of both anthropological selves and others as scholars imagine.
Asad’s own later critique of “agency” is perhaps better known than Strathern’s (Asad 1996, 1993, 2003; also Mahmood, 2005). Yet the resonance of their positions is important to register. Their shared sense that agency should not be ascribed only to those who individually confront and free themselves from hierarchy and tradition brings into view the convergence of their projects at an even more fundamental level: in their shared questioning of the “human individual” as the essential unit of anthropological analysis.
Human/secularism, individual/society
If, as I have argued, Asad’s and Strathern’s mature work grew out of a common tradition initially elaborated by Malinowski, to now explore their respective interrogations of “the human” and “the individual” is to reveal deeper affinities and begin to see how both are transformed in light of the other, through their differences. Strathern (1988) began questioning the concepts of individual and society well before Asad wrote about the human in Formations of the Secular (2003). Nevertheless, Asad’s interrogation of the human as a key figure of secularism helps make visible his keen awareness of the knowledge effects of EuroAmerican secular forms—a similar awareness to that which undergirds Strathern’s own writing. Reading Asad in fact helps elucidate how Strathern’s interrogation of individual/society contributes to an anthropology of the secular, while critiquing secularist metaphysics, even if she hardly ever uses these terms.
Asad: Secularism and the human
The chapters of the first section of Formations of the Secular explore how notions of myth, enchantment, agency, pain, and cruelty are tempered by their positions in secular discourses—so-called because they are based on a foundational distinction from religion. In the second section, Asad turns to the heart of the matter with a chapter titled: “Redeeming the Human through ‘Human Rights,’” which is largely about individualism (2003: 262). Asad describes the human individual as the primary figure of secularism. Secularism, after all, is the state (political) doctrine geared (perceived) to regulate the relation between religion and politics in order to protect individual rights, especially the right to freedom of religion. Asad’s aim is not only to reveal the “good intentions” behind the political doctrine of secularism; it is also to explore secularism’s “shadows,” which he identifies as the secular conceptual grammars that have come to constitute secularism, including its contradictions, its “dark side” (2003: 16). While there are potentially many secular grammars or traditions (see also Furani 2015), and I return to this, I distinguish as “secularist” those grammars that centrally constitute secularism.
In Asad’s hands, human rights becomes an especially rich instance of the conceptual grammars that animate both secularism and its contradictions. Asad shows that there is a particular notion of the “human” that the current human-rights regime protects, which is surprisingly limited: this regime is concerned only with the human in its capacity as a “natural,” rather than a “civil” political being. The practical paradox that this engenders is that, for example, torture is considered an abuse of human rights, but the killing of civilians through aerial bombardment is not. Another important contradiction is that if human rights do not apply to the political aspect of human bodies, which “belong” to nation-states, human-rights laws also have “no meaning” outside of the judicial institutions controlled by individual nation-states (2003: 129). Put otherwise, and this is Asad’s conclusion, human rights “become floating signifiers that can be attached to or detached from various subjects...by the most powerful nation-states” (2003: 158). In short, human rights are a universal good, but they are always elusive in practice, because they are decided or ignored by states.
If Asad shows that what counts as the “human” in the contemporary humanrights regime is quite particular, there is a second way in which he interrogates the universality of human rights. He shows how human rights, as we know them, have been shaped by Medieval and Early Modern debates about natural law, where we can find concepts and assumptions that continue to shape them today. These debates developed the idea that an individual human being has natural, inalienable rights that are independent of that being’s civil status. For instance, Hobbes (1985 [1651]) argued that sovereign individuals in a state of nature could transfer their natural rights to a political sovereign who could then end the natural state of war of all against all. Many contemporaries disagreed with Hobbes on various points, yet Asad reminds us that Hobbes posed the question that remains at the root of liberal secular politics today: How can a sovereign state best recognize and safeguard individual sovereignty?
Asad shows that through these debates, and through the legal institutionalization of their language, the human became the individual. That is, the human became “a sovereign, self-owning agent—essentially suspicious of others—and not merely a subject conscious of his or her own identity” (2003: 135 [original italics]). Crucially, the political doctrine of secularism, which upholds the individual right to religious belief free from state interference, was created precisely to protect and promote this individual, especially its sovereignty, and forestall conflict and war. That is, the individual and the liberal secularist state, which depends as much on notions of natural humanness as on the privatization of religion, were concretized together, with all of the contradictions and exclusions that this entailed.
As I noted, Formations of the Secular is not solely about the birth of the individual and its connection to the secular. Many argued similar points well before Asad (Weber is a prominent example). Yet Asad was among the first to point out the connection between the human and secularism and to denaturalize assumptions about the good of conceptions such as “human rights.” Asad’s aim was obviously not to condemn attempts to make the world a more inclusive place. Instead, he hoped to show that state secularism is less clearly a solution to social problems than a site from which modern secular personhood is defined: as an individual with rights in political society (see also Asad’s later discussions, e.g., 2015). And it is the naturalness of the notion of an individual with rights in political society that goes to the heart of why “secularism” also seems so natural—and so difficult to question.
Strathern: Individual and society
Strathern focuses on devising a form of description after or beyond the awareness that the individual should be questioned alongside the conceptual-cum-political structures elaborated to secure it. Yet it is important to understand that because she sees the individual as connected to society in the first instance, she can be read as responding to proliferating forms of Euro-American secularist politics, like Asad.
Unlike Asad, Strathern is not known for debating “politics,” anthropological or otherwise. One reason for this is that politics, often defined as the struggle over modes of power and especially governance, already casts a long shadow. Like inequality, or indeed religion, politics is a weighty Euro-American concept that is often all-too-quickly written into our ethnographies and can obscure rather than elucidate the relations we hope to describe. More importantly, however, politics is one of society’s integral domains—one of its closely allied concepts. Yet for Strathern, although she never quite puts it this way, another politics, and another metaphysics, becomes possible when we do not begin with society, its perennial companion the individual, or their analogues.
For this reason, Strathern’s work is both deeply political and yet rarely explicit about the politics of her critique of society. An important key to her attitude toward politics, which resonates with Asad’s, is an early contribution to the Manchester-based “group for debates in anthropological theory,” titled “The Concept of Society is Theoretically Obsolete.” Of course, it is important to note that she was occupying the position of a proposer of a motion, not choosing to defend her position per se. Nevertheless, her argument is instructive for understanding it: she notes that her redescription of Melanesian “society” in the Gender of the Gift was written against the backdrop of Thatcher’s (and Reagan’s) neoliberalizing governments, whose modus operandi can be characterized by Thatcher’s assertion, “There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families” (cited in Strathern, 1996: 53). For Thatcher, discarding the “abstract” notion of society made the “individual” and thus individualism real—concretizing the sense that persons are autonomous, selfowning, rational maximizers. “You see what has happened” Strathern says, “In one fell swoop Thatcherism could gather up all kinds of collectivities and organisations with a social presence and dump them. They no longer derive legitimacy from their social nature because society no longer exists” (ibid.: 54). Ultimately, Strathern notes, “[w]here the individual is produced ‘in opposition to’ society, the move conceals social formations and power relations” (ibid.). Thus, like Asad, Strathern points out the political effects of a heightened concern with individuals, as this concern can inhibit our understanding of the work of relations.
The problem of individual and society is not merely a political concern. It is also an ethnographic problem: Strathern’s interrogations were also catalyzed by her ethnographic encounters in “Melanesia” (the site of her own fieldwork but also in some sense a “fiction”), where she found that the frame of individual and society obscured how relations actually worked through persons. One of her well-known moves in Gender of the Gift was to elaborate on the Melanesian “dividual” as containing, being divided by, extensive sets of relations—with society, or relations (which she also calls sociality), being within rather than outside the person.
Strathern does not merely displace society and the individual in favor of sociality and the dividual. Rather, she recognizes that these interlinked concepts of individual and society are intimately connected to numerous other concepts that echo their form and together reproduce a certain metaphysic. It is helpful to demonstrate this displacement first with reference to Strathern’s critique of social anthropology, and especially structural-functionalism. Certainly, social anthropologists were told not to “reify” society, and to use “person” over “individual” to emphasize “how [the person] was already an element of a social relationship, already...a function of relating,” a relatum (Strathern, 2005: 41). And yet, social anthropologists were still attached to thinking with the society-form, they were concerned with describing kinship “systems[,] which made up a ‘complex unity’ or more generally...structure[s], which constituted ‘an arrangement of persons in institutionally controlled or defined relationships’”(Radcliffe-Brown, cited in Strathern, 2005: 41). That is, despite the awareness among social anthropologists that the concepts of individual and society created problems for ethnography, their conceptual attachments to encompassing, transcendent “systems,” “structures,” “complex unities” composed of individual “entities” reinstalled what I have called “society thinking” (Lebner, 2017a, 2017b). And this society thinking made certain kinds of relations, especially persons composed by relations, hard to see.
In other words, Strathern is not only concerned to displace the individual concepts of society and individual. She also tries to locate and remove from the structure of her accounts those concepts and analytical forms connected to society thinking. Her privileging of conceptual forms that make the compositional properties of relations (that is, relations as internal rather than external to entities) more visible, such as dividual and sociality, even shows how although she is constrained by scholarly language, she pushes against the concept of “the concept,” whose noun form conjures an individual entity with external relations.
This may seem quite different from Asad’s accounts in Formations of the Secular and elsewhere, which end rather than start by denaturalizing the concepts of the human and the individual, yet the overlap is important. Strathern’s writing against society thinking is also, in a deep sense, against the logic of the secularist state—a transcendent entity that produces and secures distinctions among society, religion, and politics, as much as the individual. Moreover, like Asad, Strathern is aware of and vigilant about the extension of such conceptual grammars and their colonization of others in both ethnography and politics.
Writing through relations, transforming anthropology
Just as reading Asad helps us transform Strathern into a critic of ever-expanding secular/ist logic, we can look at Strathern’s writing to deepen this understanding and to also see Asad’s own writing anew. For unlike Strathern, who offered a primer on her approach to writing against society thinking and through relations (see Strathern, 2004[1991]), Asad has not explicitly elaborated on his writing style. Yet, if read alongside Strathern’s, Asad’s writing also emerges as deliberately shaped to deflect the potential distortions produced by secularist Euro-American concepts and reason. And here a surprising fourth point of intersection comes into view, allowing for another transformation: Asad’s writing emerges as also privileging the relation and transformation over the (analytical) concept.
Strathern’s redescription
Alfred Gell (1999) was perhaps the first to write about Strathern’s challenging writing style, though few have described how it is structured at all levels around Strathern’s efforts to displace society thinking and write through relations. I noted above that this entailed not only removing the concepts of society and individual from her writing, but also removing every analytical echo of them where possible. Society thinking includes the sense of a hierarchically positioned body (such as a society, scholar, or theory) encompassing (or shaping, viewing, or comparing) individual entities (like humans, societies, objects, or concepts). Strathern’s strategy has been not just to remove this hierarchically positioning framework but to also allow a new relational metaphysic to guide her writing, which is always also analysis.
Writing through relations is perhaps more radical than it sounds. One way of describing writing through relations is that Strathern begins by displacing as much as possible her individual perspective. Instead she writes as a Melanesian might, or more precisely, as Strathern has apprehended and incorporated the Melanesian perspective grounded in relationally constituted, divided personhood. That is, she tries to write horizontally, through the relations that have come to compose her, rather than as a transcendent individual, who evaluates societies, developing a “theory” or unitary concept that will encompass and explain these social instances in an argument staged in linear form.
What does displacing the individual perspective look like on the page? Essentially, vignettes, or stories of relations, are placed in succession, often with Melanesian vignettes alongside Euro-American ones. The aim is not ultimately to compare, but to elucidate one side through the other—and to transform understandings of both, bringing them closer together—rather than to abstract, or to produce a hierarchical or scaled view. As readers may have noticed, this method has informed my own approach to bringing Asad and Strathern into relation, although Strathern displaces the individual perspective more radically than I have here.
What does it feel like to read through Strathern’s radical displacement of the individual? Simply put, as you begin to make new connections, you can feel as though you are losing yourself – but that is the point. By placing vignettes side by side, Strathern tries to reproduce (managing to not-quite-replicate) a Melanesian perspective on the movement from participant observation to writing. This redescribes and re-inscribes the challenge of ethnographic experience both as research practice and as artefact of narrative. In other words, her analogical ethnographic writing seeks to convey what it is like to try to see, write, and understand the world as Melanesians might, through relations first and last.
Asad’s redescription
David Scott’s description of Asad’s writing now offers a useful counterpoint to my description of Strathern’s:
[Asad’s] inquiries always have about them a deliberatively exploratory...provisional character ...[He is] “sketching landscapes” (to [conjure] Wittgenstein) ...[rather than offering] a series of monographs compiling comprehensive accounts of the way the world is there—or then. (Scott, 2006)
Scott also shows how a certain tension marks Asad’s style of investigation (Scott, 2006: 320; Note 4). On one side are Asad’s genealogical concerns inspired by Michel Foucault, that is, a skepticism toward power/knowledge and an intention to interrogate its effects. On another side is Alasdair MacIntyre’s concept of tradition, which Asad first engaged in 1986 (Note 3). It is this tension between genealogy and tradition, Scott claims, that explains why, for example, Genealogies (1993) “does not take the form of a thoroughgoing deconstruction of...contemporary anthropological understandings of religion, but moves on quickly to describe (or better, redescribe) aspects of...contrasting religious traditions, medieval Christianity and Islam” (Scott, 2006: 140). This is also why Asad is reluctant to write as a conventional critic, as one “who already knows...the directions ...[of] his dissatisfactions” (ibid.: 137).
It is certainly the case that skepticism of conventional Euro-American knowledge and critical modalities have guided Asad. However, with the tradition of British anthropology in view, and with Strathern in mind, one might offer another reading. In his later work, Asad has chosen to decompose and displace conventional concepts by writing through the relations between and within them. Rather than offer a systematic argument about the boundaries or definition of religion and secular, in Genealogies of Religion and Formations of the Secular, Asad chooses to move between the description and the unbinding of these concepts. He does this most notably in the latter volume, where his even more fluid writing conveys through form as much as content his substantive argument: that secularism is enmeshed and sustained by—and can only be grasped through examining—a broader domain of ever-shifting-but-interrelated secular concepts, conceivable as such because they are distinguished from religion. I explored this above in relation to his discussion of the human, but it is important to emphasize that while Asad identifies predominant grammars that have animated secularism, like indeed the self-owning and autonomous human individual, he also moves consistently through different conceptual constellations. Asad wants to remind us of two nearly opposite points at once: first that contemporary secularism is sustained by a secular epistemology that has had particular political effects, and second that the secular more broadly is constantly moving, expanding, and transforming.
If the secular is ever-transforming, and is thus not a discretely bounded episteme but instead is spreading, can we ever escape? Asad engages this question only implicitly. Scott has described Asad’s thought as more tragic than romantic in this regard. If romance assumes a “horizon of emancipation ...[where] the past is there to be overcome on the way to a preconstituted future,” Scott explains, then “the tragic sensibility is poignantly aware of the ineradicable metaphysical traces that connect us to what we leave behind” (2006: 152). I concur with Scott’s evocation of a certain dwelling with impossibility, but I see Asad as more sanguine and less bound to the secularist valuation of “pleasure and pain” than Scott’s conern with tragedy allows (see also Iqbal’s critique, 2020). Asad’s writing implies that though the secular might be spreading, there are many ways that it will be disturbed and redirected, both within and outside of scholarship—a fact to which anthropologists, he insists, should remain attuned.
It is in this final sense that Asad’s work intersects with Strathern’s, whose mature work is directly committed to both the impossibility of escape and to the work of relations, and therefore ultimately to transformation. Strathern shows that it is possible to find and develop an alternative metaphysic from within the broader secular Euro-American tradition—as long as we make space for, and work through, the differences we find within it. After all, relation is itself a model and conduit of “secular knowledge,” as Strathern has noted in one of the only places she has used the term “secular” (1995: 18). Relation can be so considered, she argues, because the relation was “ushered in with the seventeenth or eighteenth century conviction that world (nature) is open to scrutiny” (ibid., see alsoStrathern 2005: 62). The world being put “on the same plane” as humans (1995: 18) while humans’ terrestrial relations are distinguished from the divine, is precisely, Asad might clarify, what makes ‘relations’ a secular model of knowledge.
Yet it is important to underscore that a relational metaphysic, even if it might be “secular,” is different from the predominant secularist metaphysic that haunts many anthropological projects. A relational metaphysic, for example, does not seek to determine and hold in place entities, such as individuals, concepts, or societies. Rather, it leaves open the possibility that whatever might be perceived as an autonomous entity mediated through “external” relations, can actually be
constituted by, preceded by, “internal” relations.7
Though Asad does not explicitly adopt a relational metaphysic, I do not think that he would disagree about its importance for scholars, and for anthropologists in particular. Asad, like Strathern, is ultimately telling his readers that they should remain aware not only of the secularist tradition that has come to dominate thought and practice through the state form. He is also asking readers to remain open to apprehending the many other secular traditions, their potential others, and the relations between them, being elaborated within the west and beyond.
Conclusion
Because my aim has been to focus on the connections between the works of Asad and Strathern—in order to transform our understanding of their radicalizing work—other relevant influences and traditions have been backgrounded. One influence was the “crisis in representation,” a period when anthropologists precisely began questioning how to write about others. The crisis in representation was arguably an outgrowth of the political turn in US anthropology, and it was represented most famously by the book Writing Culture, which was a critique of the predominant cultural anthropology at the time, especially of one of its key proponents, Clifford Geertz. I have only mentioned in passing Asad’s important critiques of Geertz, which preceded Writing Culture, and I have essentially ignored Strathern’s temporary and mischievous alliance with culture in her critique of society (1988). I have focused instead on the earlier British anthropological tradition that quietly grounded Asad’s and Strathern’s experiments with writing, and which inspired their respective responses to “cultural anthropological” reactions to the crisis. Indeed, in their own ways, Asad and Strathern questioned the very forms in which anthropologists write more than any of the more radically self-conscious discussants of the “crisis in representation.”
While recalling Geertz at this juncture is no substitute for that discussion, he offers a counterpoint for my conclusion. Works and Lives, Geertz’s memorable response to Writing Culture, diagnoses a style that Asad, Strathern, and others had begun distancing themselves from in the 1980s. Geertz called this style Akobo Realism, after a little-known text, “Operations on the Akobo and Gila Rivers 1940–41,” which describes Evans-Pritchard’s military exploits in the Sudan during World War II. Written for the readership of The Army Quarterly (i.e., not for anthropologists), Evans-Pritchard’s text displays the essence of his approach to writing: “There is the suppression of any sign of the struggle with words...the overriding point of every image, every elegance, every nod, is to demonstrate that nothing, no matter how singular, resists reasoned description” (Geertz 1988: 61). Evans-Pritchard, Geertz infers, homogenized the more anxious “I-Witnessing” initiated by Malinowski and consolidated the sound of the British “School,” which “is held together far more by this manner of going about things in prose than it is by any sort of consensual theory or settled method” (ibid.: 59). Geertz admits, however, that the style had spread. It was an incredibly powerful “theatre of language—in ethnography, the most powerful yet constructed.... Even most Americans sound, by now, a bit like ‘Operations on the Akobo’” (ibid.). Nevertheless, this language only “bends our categories...it does not break them” (ibid.: 61).
Geertz had neither Asad nor Strathern in mind when writing this, but his account throws into relief a number of points I have made in this paper. I began by arguing that what united the British “School” was more than style. I revisited the history of translation in early British social anthropology to show that it was influenced far more by Malinowski—and indeed Malinowski’s interrogation of theory and analytical concepts through ethnography—than Oxfordcentered histories, including Asad’s own, often allowed.
Revisiting this anthropological tradition then helped me to begin describing the connections between, and transforming, Asad’s and Strathern’s work. It made visible how Asad’s and Strathern’s respective responses to the political turn in anthropology—their interrogation of some of its key concepts—both drew on their anthropological tradition and transformed it. Then, continuing to read them alongside one another helped transform the apprehension of each in turn. On the one hand, I explored the convergence of their projects at their concern with the human/individual in secularism/society, and we began to see how Strathern could be considered a student of the secular. On the other hand, through my discussion of their experiments with writing, I showed how both aimed to displace predominant secularist concepts and forms of argument, and how Asad, like Strathern, even pushed against the concept of “the concept” in anthropology, by writing through relations.
Reading Asad and Strathern together also reminds us that they were writing against something that Geertz’s description of Akobo Realism implies but does not elaborate analytically: that conventional “reasoned description,” and especially its general protection of our modes of classification, might indeed be a colonial war by other means. It is a discouraging and even uncomfortable point, most acutely because most of us can do little about it. That is, most of us do not have the skill to so radically experiment with scholarly conventions, and, if we do, we will likely not be allowed such experimentation by journals, reviewers, and editors (not to mention hiring and tenure committees), especially early in our careers. How, then, to proceed?
I should underscore that I have not argued that readers should attempt to emulate Asad’s or Strathern’s writing, and I do not think that either scholar would want this. For instance, Strathern has explicitly invited others to develop their own forms of writing through the different relations that compose them (Strathern, 2011). I have merely made a most general suggestion: that we should read Asad and Strathern together because both the form and content of their writing can help consolidate insights, arguments, and ultimately politics through which anthropologists can continue to write and transform their traditions.
But more specifically, such reading can help invigorate two areas of anthropological and interdisciplinary debate that have been largely conducted separately to date. One area is the study of secularism, indebted to Asad, which has thrived but is now stalling on its focus on the state governance of religion and the destabilization of the religion–politics binary (see also Lebner, 2015). While this focus has been productive to date, it forgets what Asad and even Strathern might say: even if the state is a powerful site of these forms of categorization, it is not the only source. Rather, whole domains of thought and practice quietly proceed in some distinction to religion, thus re-entrenching it, both within and beyond the state, in EuroAmerica and at many sites beyond—including in academic scholarship. We cannot therefore remain so focused on one or two concepts; we must train ourselves in the details of secular conceptual relations and distinctions and especially their secularist constellations, even as we challenge them.
Anthropologists of science and medicine have begun elaborating an allied perspective, in particular noting that “less attention has been paid to how the work of constructing political secularity has itself been achieved through [science] and medicine” (Whitmarsh and Roberts, 2016: 204; Roberts, 2016). Moreover, these scholars note that anthropological studies of science and medicine have largely proceeded in an unselfconsciously secularist fashion: they have generally deemed “natural” the distinctions between science and religion, and as result have treated the “religious” elements they encounter as epiphenomenal—“unreal”—rather than constitutive of the nature in question. However, what we learn from the intersections of Asad’s and Strathern’s work is that an answer to anthropologists’ unselfconscious secularity seems to lie less in embracing a “nonsecular” approach, as Whitmarsh and Roberts suggest, or even simply displacing the naturalist distinction between nature and culture, as advocated also by proponents of the ontological turn, who often dialogue with anthropologists of science (Holbraad and Pedersen, 2017; Viveiros de Castro, 2003; see discussion in Lebner, 2017b). Instead, reading Asad and Strathern together reminds us that it might be hard to find a definitive “outside” to the secular in our scholarly concepts and languages, even as we can write against secularist metaphyiscs.
What seems necessary is precisely for anthropologists to become more attuned to secular formations, not with the aim of definitively escaping them but with the goal of becoming aware of how the most weighty secularist assumptions—those conceptual and interpersonal relations that echo in the secularist state—might affect our ethnographies and our politics. I have been trying throughout to distinguish the particularities of secularist metaphysics from the domain of the secular more broadly, although the extent of the secular–secularist difference remains an open question. As I have discussed at length elsewhere (Lebner, 2015), there is a tendency among some readers of Asad to read the secular as also, inextricably, “secularism,” which can be escaped if we simply stop asking about the difference between religion and politics. Reading Asad with Strathern, however, I am not convinced it is so easy to remove all trace of the distinction from religion in our scholarly languages. Indeed, if we pretend it is not there even when it is, or if we ignore the connection between contemporary realities and the secular, we may risk succumbing to secularist naturalism once more. For now, then, a combined effort to seek conventional secularist grammars and their others seems to be a key tool for discerning difference and facilitating transformation within the secular scholarly languages through which anthropologists still, inevitably, write. Indeed, for good or ill, whether it is spoken or not, our scholarly languages are still quietly considered not to be “religious.” Though it is clearly vital for anthropologists to continue to make space for religious perspectives, I do not think the distinction between them and scholarly languages will be dissolved any time soon, even if we declare the difference irrelevant.
Thus I have wanted to convey what Asad’s and Strathern’s work together suggest: that secular logics proliferate, often naturalizing the secularist primacy of the concepts of individual, state, and society (and their echoes) over the transformative potential of relations. Yet the latter’s potential effects on our descriptions cannot be mitigated only by mobilizing or displacing this or that concept, as no one or two concepts contain the power to stifle our ethnographies and retrench our conservative politics, or for that matter, free them. This does not mean that we should stop displacing and creating concepts. Rather, it seems that it is only by first keeping all the conceptual and interpersonal relations and distinctions in view— with an eye on their potentially secular/ist natures – that we can begin to enact the transformations that our traditions invite, and that our future politics (if we should even call it politics) will ultimately require.8
